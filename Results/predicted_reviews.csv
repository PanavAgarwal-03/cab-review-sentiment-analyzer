Two words: [cheap] grocery delivery! Glad I checked Uber on a whim one day while I was in a Lyft and found it's really expanded what it is. Definitely not what it was 10 years ago. (An expensive ride request app.) They roll out offers all the time. My grocery pick up from my local store costs about $6 which is awesome when I need my items asap and can't get immediate delivery from store. I plan to try more of what they offer.

The biggest problem was that I was having a trolley and a soldier bag with me and I wasted my 1 hour at out of sukhdev vihar metro station at 11:00 pm night.

"Great driver. Love her to death. I've ridden with her multiple times. Made great conversation and music was amazing. There are only 2 issues. 1, she has incredibly bad rode rage, and 2, She one time dropped me off and then called me the next day, saying she doesn't remember taking me home and getting home herself. For these reasons, I'm giving her 4 stars. (Would have been 3, but the road rage is actually quite comical to me, so I gave her 4.)",Driver Behavior,Positive

You guys seriously need to fix this. So I transferred $15 out of my savings to get a ride. There were no cars available after waiting for about 5-10 minutes. So I cancel and low and behold there's a driver available. So I go to try again only to find that I can't because $10 has been taken out of my account due to pressing confirm. No money should be taken out until the driver has arrived or in the case of late fees. I shouldn't have to wait for it to be refunded and take more out of my savings,Driver Behavior,Negative

I've been an Uber driver now for 4 years and that 4 years I've had nothing but good things to say about Uber but this last year I have been treated horrible through them.

So after this year's up I will be driving away from Uber :/,Driver Behavior,Negative

Worst app! I urgently needed to go to a place and first I wasn't able to find a driver. When someone accepted the ride the driver cancelled after 5 minutes. It's so frustrating! Worst app. There is no proper customer care services and the prices are also very high. Edit: Today I had to wait for 20 minutes. At last the driver cancelled the ride and I got late. If a customer cancels the ride he/she has to pay charges but drivers don't need to pay any. WHY??,App Experience,Negative

"Uber monopoly is bad for us all. Collection pick up times are inaccurate, taking longer to arrive than suggested. Pricing has become too expensive relative to normal taxis, but they have been forced out. The app is poor for customer protections. Eg a recent poor experience was difficult to report. In normal circumstances I wouldn't have paid for the fare, but with Uber you're stuck paying for a substandard journey. Generally, driver quality is terrible (confusing dangerously slow with safe!)",App Experience,Negative

Customer service has been very disappointing lately. I reported a package driver and I saw on the app that the driver made a 30 minute stop elsewhere. I called the driver and he proceeds to lie and tell me he is stuck on the N2 traffick at 1pm!!! I reported this because the price went up almost double the amount and Uber never resolved that issue.

Good in USA but lots of issues when traveling. I'm living in South America for an extended amount of time and the drivers only want to be paid in cash. They get frustrated if you pay in card even if you tip generously and they will give you 1 star reviews for this. UBER please tell drivers the payment method of the rider and do not allow drivers to give fake reviews to riders. My rider rating has absolutely plummeted from 1 star reviews from this trip alone.,Driver Behavior,Negative

A good app for seeing options and rides nearby. But I'm sick of drivers accepting jobs and then cancelling on the way to pick up - presumably because a better job has come in.

4 days ago I requested a cash trip for my mom. The driver was given cash but I still had the amount owing on my account. This amount which was already paid affected my next trip which resulted in me having to settle it before I could request a trip. I paid for a single trip twice. After multiple escalations to Uber this issue remains unresolved with agents advising that it has been resolved.

The 'reserve a ride' feature is also quite disappointing- the ride almost always arrives 10 or 15 minutes earlier than reserved, and this makes the cancellation policy obscene- I had to rush carrying five bags only to have the driver cancel.",App Experience,Negative

Uber Shuttle booking is not happening and asking uber payment option to change. Worst app and worst company. Every time driver issues are there. Very unsafe. No complaint management.

An unacceptable bug occurred. I requested a ride to my home and the app simply displayed the location of where I was.

"I started using UBER six months ago, and its standard operating procedures are efficient. The drivers arrived early, so I arrived early for my doctor's appointments. The drivers also possess great customer service skills. The PRO is that I no longer rely on public transportation for my medical appointments. The CON is the increased cost to use UBER. At the age of 70 health dilemmas, I had to compromise.",Driver Behavior,Positive

"Do not use Uber on a daily basis. Uber and it's driver are inconsistent. You can't even provide feedback if a driver cancels you when you've been waiting for 30 minutes. Most, if not all, promotions are lying to you. Especially the Klarna 50% off when it isn't even 50%. And payments go thru pending when you ask for a ride, not when you receive one. So if Uber cancels your 20$ rides 5 times, guess you dont have 100$ until it falls back into your account at some point. Terrible experience overall",Driver Behavior,Negative

I am having worst experience of booking rides nowadays in Uber. Every time I pay to driver after my ride is completed.

When I am getting late for office I don't have time to raise concern by going to help section and scrolling all over the options.

The worst and terrible app I have used. They will charge at a fixed cost and the drivers won't accept pre-paid payments because they want more payments from the customer.

Once, I had to pay a driver extra 40/- and then I raised a complaint, then Uber ""refunded"" me 40/- as uber cash, and guess what, the ride prices were hiked up by 40/- on my account only, I checked on other ppl's phone, no such price hike.",App Experience,Neutral

But if you must, run a DVLA check first... If your record is anything but spotless, assume the hirer's won't release a vehicle and Uber will make a tidy profit.",App Experience,Negative

Uber shuttle Driver did not stop at the location and despite calling him there was no response. Firstly the bus was late and then he drives past without stopping or even picking the call. Understand that you are offering a promotional free ride but doesn't count if the service is not serving the purpose. I wasted 30 min and had to make expensive travel arrangement to reach on time for another meeting. Poor service from Uber. Will not recommend Uber shuttle service.,Driver Behavior,Negative

I booked a ride from 9700 Starbucks to Shell Providence Road Matthews for $9.93 that should have left a balance in Uber cash of $10.31. Uber took the $10.31 for no reason.

Support is awful. Scams you with the up to 20 percent off with shared rides. In reality it'll take 15 minutes out your day to knock a single dollar off the charge. When your spending 30 bucks that's embarrassing. Uber is such a scam. To update Uber sucks even worse. They now got the ride share giving wildly inaccurate time-frames and you always end up spending 15 to 20 minutes extra in a ride when they NEVER knock the dollar off even anymore. Disgusting and trash service. Wish there was better.,Customer Support,Negative

Then I tried to give review to the driver for his bad behavior and I couldn't because I canceled the ride. I still paid him full money and more though... so I told the service about it and thet didn't refund me or allowed me to review the driver. So customer support does nothing :)",Customer Support,Negative

"As a service, Uber consistently fails to meet expectations. The core purpose of the platform is to deliver reliable and convenient transportation, yet it often falls short. Whether it's delayed rides, cancellations, or poor customer support, there seems to be a lack of accountability for these recurring issues. If the service can't deliver on its primary promise, what's the point of using it?",Customer Support,Negative

Anyone who has a 3 star or above does not regularly use Uber. They intentionally increase prices for individual customers if they think you will keep going to the same location. They charge you more and rip off the drivers. Their fees are ridiculous and only seem reasonable if you use them to get to very different locations and use the app very rarely. It's a stupid business decision and very exploitative. Imagine having a restaurant and charging your most frequent customers more. 0 stars,App Experience,Negative

Shocking service. Waited inside the hospital at 3am after a family member had just passed away. Ride was accepted so I went out through the security doors to wait for the ride. Driver then cancelled the ride leaving me stuck outside in the rain with no taxi. If a driver accepts the ride they shouldn't be able to cancel it for another. Thank god there's still normal taxi companies to call and I was able to get home.,Driver Behavior,Positive

Great to use in different countries especially to avoid handling cash. However the app regularly shows less than the actual fare by showing discounts that mysteriously disappear when I actually make the booking - and by the time you realise it's too late. This has happened to me several times now and really puts me off using the app as I can't rely on the quoted price being the price I will actually pay!!,App Experience,Negative

I am not sure what has taken place the past months but I hope to see a class action lawsuit for the misleading times that come up for how far the driver is away. Not accurate and the you select what you are assuming is how ever far away the driver is and then you go to finding driver and infant there are no drivers that times distance away. This had been happening consistently for.the pat few months then it says will connect to a driver by another time after. What was 4 min was 25 to wait lie,Driver Behavior,Neutral
