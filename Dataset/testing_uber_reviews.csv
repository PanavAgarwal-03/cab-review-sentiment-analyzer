"Never using uber again in Europe, thry charged me twice for trips I didn't take, it is not safe to add your credit card, be aware"
Nice app
"muita demora para achar uma corrida, e depois de muita demora selecionam um motorista longe e se cancelamos porque vai demorar muito ainda pagamos taxa."
"It's been 8 months for now & this app is getting worse day by day. 1. When I click on ""call driver"" button, it display error page. WHY? 2. The driver himself is not able to callback due to app issues. 3. Everytime I open app, it asks for phone no. & things(despite of me already being logged in) 4. App hangs multiple times (despite being updated, cache clear, full sim range)"
Customer care doesn't exist
Your location services are horrible please fix it
Good
Very laye and herd settings
"Quote you one price and charge you another (higher) price, for trips booked in advance"
Today one horrible experience I faced ...I booked one Uber go for one operation patient drop off...but after 20mins waiting driver named Tarun sarker forced me to cancel my ride...I requested him several times telling the condition of my operation patient...he tell rudely "apni ja paren Amar korun ami jabona" and forced me to cancel the trip.what type of nonsense behavior is this? I never expect such type of rude behavior from Uber drivers.
Quick and reliable.

"Horrible, bunch of thieves. The fare you see when booking versus the fare you pay is completely different. The drivers make unrequested stops, drive slow, and extend the trip themselves, then the fare increases. I hate using Uber. They are very skelm. The drivers stop to top up on their fuel, and you are charged for the additional time he spent doing that. When I report it with evidence, I am told the trip is not eligible for a discount, and the fare is correct. Pissed off!!!!!"

"Met with a potentially fatal accident due to Uber bike driver while I was a pillion on the very ride. The bike driver was likely drunk or on drugs. I have been on months of bed rest with post accident conditions lasting up until now ... entering year 2025 and still grappling with th post accident mental and physical trauma. And yes, not forgetting to mention, the bike driver ran from the spot after ramming the speeding vehicle and leaving me wounded and unconscious. This was in Punjab, India."

Efficience and seamless
This ap is so good

Asking extra payment for each trips .
Best app for all ride services
first time journey by uber and experience well with the drive and the driver too well maintained.
Cancellation is very tough
Drivers asking extra money always

Indeed great service and sky high trust. As we left cab we received a call that our one bag has left in his car. He returned it after 15 minutes of traffic. Thanks.
Very Nice and easy to book and supportive

"I booked uber auto, nice experience"
Nice ride
Excellent experience
Good app in india
المنقذ ♥️!
Rapido is the best app
Rates are actually too high 😔 sometimes I feel like being a regular customer means nothing to Uber all they want is to change high price..
"Quick pickup from the River Rock casino back to my girl's place in a very nice Tesla by a very good driver. I would reccommend Uber to anybody. Affordable, fast, friendly and legit less than half of what a taxi would cost."
Good
Shocking that it goes up so high in price! Should never be as expensive as it offers. Shocking
Awesome uber
Use full app
"Better than ola,"
I like it
Verry good
"Does what it promises, but when you add card payment, uber gets shady. I get deducted a random amount during a random day. Sometimes, a huge amount is deducted and credited back to my card, but they always send a few cents short. Happened numerous times already (eg: charges 20.50 and returns 20.05)"
Quick & Easy No Delay
Very good 👍
It is good
timely pick
Affordable price and fast pickup in my locality and polite conversation with passenger
"I have booked ride of rupees 68 and he has taken different route and told 130 but on screen it was 87rupees and my grandparents were travelling and it has not happened one time now it has happened more then 10 times same problem,so I am requesting uber to fix this faster otherwise we have to take some action."

It's was okay 👍 he arrived in time
Auto Driver accepted my request. And not moving towards me. I have waited for auto around 20 minutes after than i have called auto driver and he said he will come to me but he never moved the vehicle at all towards me and then I canceled the booking. After then I booked bike and auto cancellation charges included in bike ride. I'm very disappointed by Uber and Uber Autorikshaw Drivers. Now I'm using private travels vehicles and I'm happy now.

"100 cancellation before someone accepts, only to then cancel on you when they're like 2min away. This company became a joke, extremely unreliable. Also some serious creeps using this, it's becoming unsafe especially for female riders. And if you report it..guess what, someone copy and pastes the same response to you and there's no consequences. it's hard to report anything, and there's no way at all to contact a human. I hope they go bust. Use Didi it's better. They also buy 5 star reviews."
I love that the fairs are so cheap and the drivers are nice

"I would have given even lesser rating if there was an option. When I booked a cab on my last ride, the final amount shown was 70 percent more than what was initially shown and there is no way to contact the customer support to sort it out. Initially it has shown 300 and I had to pay 524. I hope u respond uber"

"Very bad experience, driver charge extra money. I contact custumar care, he says that we can not do anything"
Nice app. Easy to book. But when a ride got canceled because Driver requested and trying again is picked by same Driver that can be avoided. Otherwise good
Fast sarvice and comfortable
"Wrost apps before booking it's showing a price but after you arrive at the site, the price automatically doubles showing.... Bloody idiot uber .. Rapido and Ola are superior to Uber."

Two words: [cheap] grocery delivery! Glad I checked Uber on a whim one day while I was in a Lyft and found it's really expanded what it is. Definitely not what it was 10 years ago. (An expensive ride request app.) They roll out offers all the time. My grocery pick up from my local store costs about $6 which is awesome when I need my items asap and can't get immediate delivery from store. I plan to try more of what they offer. A big help since losing my car
Wow
Convenient and easy to assess.
Good drive experience
"Charged more than what was shown, no customer support for regular customers. Highly unprofessional."
They charge for traffic jam but it's not our hand. I wouldn't recommend

"Can't get away from forced ads. I've turned off ad notifications and confirmed it's off but continue to get ads pushed to me. I can uninstall the app between uses, but what a pain."
Great service
easiest and quickest way to get from Orlando Airport to Disneyworld
A fantastic company
Awful service...You guys should not give any access or an account to an Uber driver who doesn't wants to accept a ride if it's a low cost ride. If your service only works for for long rides and more money then it doesn't seem to have an exact purpose of your service... Work on it .. I have been noticing this same problem since few weeks. It's awful
மிக நன்று
"In Domincan Republic the drivers are asking you for money and they don't care what the apps say, before they go they ask you where you go and how much the apps say and then they tell you that they will make the trips for more money, and if you acept and take the car they cancel the trips on the app like this almost all the money its for them, @uber you have to do something with this."
Very efficient and fast service
"Horrible little extortionate app that tries to rob you of everything that it can. Average wait time for getting cancelled on by drivers is about 15+mins. Total scam, drivers cancel on you continuously as the fees go up and up to extortionate amounts, went from £20 to £55 for no reason. Absolutely zero customer service, unreal that this poor level of service is permitted, total cash grab and mockery. For the worst service choose UBER. Disgusting"
The worst app ever..they don't even deserve 1 star rating. Their drivers fooled people and take more than double amount as compared to the actual fare shown in the app and when we try to ask for help from customer service they just say "Thank you for understanding and providing the feedback of the driver. We can't refund the amount as it was done outside the service " ... ridiculous
"I use Lyft because they partner with Hilton and United airlines, but Uber is virtually everywhere."
Berry efficient ☆☆☆☆☆
Excellent ride came within 2 minutes better than taxi fares
Good service 👍 thanks 😊 🙏
Its easy for trip and Osam ..its my first trip in uber.
"8 años usando esta aplicación y puedo decir que es una completa basura. Cada viaje te quita centavos que con el paso del tiempo, se vuelven pesos. Cada vez toma peores rutas y las tarifas dinámicas me han hecho abandonar totalmente este servicio."
"Today I received a mail that if I am not used this app, my account will be deleted. Now it's your app so you can delete. But I faced some horrible incident , if I choose uber go option then it showed that ' finding driver '; some time your driver reject the drive. So what I can do? The other app also find helpful at that time. And lastly your price is so high than other app.."
The driver did fantastic !!
"I don't like the cancelation fee to be honest. The fact I paid extra for priority pick up it said 6 minutes I waited 8,I know it's only 2 minutes but that's false advertising and no it wasn't the drivers fault yall just took extra change from me for nothing 😒. The price hikes are ridiculous some days which causes me to deny the service all together if I can't afford it but other then that it's a really nice app most people (drivers) are nice and personable most importantly reliable 💯"
I m using this app for long time. best app to Book a ride in easy way.
Just the fact of the stress from driving is worth it. Every time I use Uber I have a wonderful experience. Thank you!
Excellent
"I thought that the service was wonderful, and I'm getting to where you need to be, you're pretty much on time. I would definitely recommend."

"Uber used to be good, but now they are just ripping you off. Please don't do it. Update they just keep getting higher. They want me to pay 25 dollars for a 5 min ride"
That was the best uber ride I ever had. Such a nice guy!!
Not bad

"So if the drivers tend to switch off the App after getting into the Vehicle there by overcharging you.. But there are those who are genuine, steady on the road and also respectful"
"Very reliable app overall. Its customer service is not great: If you have a non typical issue, you have to request the same thing multiple times until they finally do it."
Uber has great customer care .I had experienced an issue with the charges and the response was very fast and I had a great support experience.
Nyc drivers

very long time waiting no vehicles available
A website had deducted R50 from my account for no reason... I had not even used the app yet or requested any rides so far
Should show details about the rider ratings.

"My driver listened to my suggestions, and also got me to my destination on time"
"Tipped €5 cash as app sent us to weiner konzerthaus instead of AM konzerthaus. Gratefully obliged and good smoothe ride, thank you."
Super duper nise app
The app is very useful. I find it very useful.
"I had my first Uber ride today. Not only was the driver prompt and polite but very honest. I inadvertently left my cell phone on the back seat when I exited his vehicle. He returned my phone to me in a very reasonable amount of time and I truly appreciate his kindness and consideration. Needless to say, I tipped him accordingly."
It's safe for me

"16 drivers in a row cancel, then the one that shows up drives off as I'm walking up to the car. If you look at Reddit, all you see is Uber drivers congratulating each other for screwing over customers like this. Horrible, undependable service."
Very Pleasant
Excellent.

"WHEN PAYING WITH A CARD, I GET CHARGED TWICE! ONCE WHEN ORDERING A RIDE, AND AGAIN FULL PRICE THE NEXT DAY WHEN THERE'S AN ADJUSTMENT. IF THE RIDE HAS AN ADJUSTMENT, WHY AM I GETTING CHARGED FULL PRICE INSTEAD OF JUST THE EXTRA CHARGES LIKE TOLL OR WAITING FEE? UBER WHEN PAYING WITH A CARD IS TERRIBLE. TOO MANY COMPLICATIONS. MOST DAYS I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, BEING CHARGED AGAIN FOR A RIDE I ALREAFY PAID FOR YESTERDAY. WITH NO REFUNDS. IT IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO SEND A NORMAL MESSAGE ON THE APP."

"My Uber drivers, with few exceptions, are amazing people trying to make a living. My Uber experience, on the other hand, absolutely sucks. Been standard jg in the cold for 15 min now. One driver accepted my ride, held me for 11 min, and then simply cancelled. Twelve people have come and gone from the Uber stand, while I wait."
Ricardo is great and his car is roomy and clean! Thank you!
"Execrabil! Initial app imi da 7 minute asteptare, comand, apoi imi da 20 min. Si asta nu e tot:soferul renunta la cursa, in apropiere fiind,si-mi inchide telefonul in nas! Preluat apoi de alta masina, dupa alte 10 minute de asteptare!"

When your passenger wait for minutes and then your driver cancel ride how much Uber pay to passenger?
So far has been seamless use.
"Panamá: Las tarifas se han vuelto exageradas, en horas de demanda suben a niveles de 3, 4, 5, 6 veces más que el precio de un taxi regular, adicionalmente me envían una promo de descuento de 30% en el siguiente viaje y cuando se hizo hora de demanda, desapareció la opción de la promo, muy de mal gusto esas tácticas, agarré un taxi regular y ya."
Ok but price promotions are needed also
Overall excellent service!
Excellent work
Nice
My first time using Uber but the experience has been great. I will definitely be using it from now onwards.
"During rush hours we couldn't find rides, and car in Kolkata are very bad, when I book for sedan car are very very bad, drivers are refusing to start AC."
"Price manipulation (checked Uber prices at ~00:45: ~36 EUR; checked taxi prices on the Internet; returned to Uber at ~00:50: price raised to 73.24 EUR). Charges you for rides you don't take because driver cancelled or never showed up. Often stops updating. Unreliable waiting time (often increases instead of decreasing). Rides arrive and leave without you, forcing you to wait 1+ hour for another driver. Doesn't let you review drivers who never show up. Now charges extra to get the closest driver."
Worst app
"The driver was calm and not over speed, i really enjoy my ride"
never ever had any problems I promise and I been using Uber for 4 years mabey longer
"Muito ruim ultimamente. Está muito difícil de encontrar motorista, quando encontra muitas vezes este cancela a corrida. O aplicativo também troca o lugar, principalmente de destino. Eu tenho o cuidado de marcar certinho, rua e número, o lugar onde quero chegar, mas os motoristas muitas vezes me deixam em outro lugar, outra entrada do prédio, outro lado da quadro, e se eu reclamo o motorista ainda acha ruim."

"Multiple times this app will change my location for no reason whatsoever and refuse to let me update it to the correct location. The result ends up being aim out the money I spent on the order. If I'm trying to have food delivered to my home why does this app suddenly change its location, and if this is a known issue why would you not allow an address change within a time frame or at least do a full refund. I'm Uninstaller because every time I use this app it's a gamble"

I kept complaining from other person's app using uber,sent mails to customer support,tried calling representative but no one recieved the call. finally the cab driver kept my phn on charging & I got connected to him & he came to return my phone & charged me good amount for getting it back. I can't understand y can't uber got me connected to the driver if I know the cab's no.my ride details etc customer support is pathetic 😡"
Good one better then

"Excellent , on time"
It always changed price same location no fix price and not chat with customer option this app change price of cab like crypto currency trading app money go up and down same way this app change price there should be price in per kilometre ride but in this app price go up and down
"In West bengal, this app is of no use, because nobody understands map or stoppage matter, and demands extra money! If not given, behaves rude!"
"Absolutely would not recommend and would go as far as to say theyre thieves, like 50$ gone according to my banks app for the 3 failed rides, but uber app says i wasnt charged"

Having to register to see rough estimate is an invasion of privacy
Good service
Been using Uber for a long time now and I am mostly very happy with service and support 👍🏻
"Many time ride is not coming, showing coming in 80- 90 min after the scheduled time. It actually means, it will never come. There is no call centre to handle the call. Driver never pick call at this situation. Why uber confirm booking,if there is no such ride. It happens with me 4 time in 40 days. No any option to write correct reason. Just have to cancel the ride after waiting 1 hour."
"Safe, reliable and affordable"
Sometimes I Have A Few Issues But It's Dependable For The Most Part
V good
Affordable however need to wait for the ride too much
Precisa ajustar mais rapidamente o valor da corrida. 10 minutos esperando e nada de ajuste.
"Unfair demand of full rental amount as cancellation charges even thou it is due to car mechanical issue. I booked Uber rentals in Jaipur, Rs851/ was shown as rental. After vehicle arrived, I observed name plate no. difference and it is white board. As I was in hurry I boarded. Immediately the vehicle started making loud sounds when asked him why, he searched for mechanic, but didn't get one. Then he started scoldingme & told if you don't want to travel cancel ride and Get out. GOODBYE Uber"
Is so good but one day no driver came for pick up
It's just a trash app having an overall 2 drivers I don't even no why is this app is still available in Romania. Just wasting your time with searching for a inexistent driver that will never accept the request because there isn't any.
Best prices
Service has been on point . Can't really complain.
"All the rides don't deserve a five star rating, anything less than five stars, you can't give an rating. Only options are what y'all give to command five star ratings."

1 star minus because not accurate price show in system. Value in decimal always round above then whats the point giving offer in decimal?
"I Love Uber Ride, It's safe 100%"
La app muy bien. Sencilla de usar. Servicio excelente
Just got in a 5 car accident on the highway with my family on our way to the airport. We had to pull the the break down lane. Called Uber and I was told I was going to get reimbursed the ride to the airport. She said to order another Uber and see if I can get picked up on the breakdown lane in a highway. That was the best they could do she said.
I had book a trip on uber which shows me charges of 65 rupees but after my destination arrived auto driver charge 98 rupees from me. Due to this mistake uber is not app which I had expected
Best way to getaround town with less fuss than friends and family lol
"Always sends me drivers 20-25 minutes away. I'll order an Uber at 6 30 and get to my job that's 15 minutes away after 7, usually 20 minutes late. I think this is to get you to pay more and order uber priority. Recently switched to lyft. Always quicker pick up times."
Hello Uber is ride price some joke to you while i am booking it's showing one price and once ride completed in driver Uber app it's showing more price again I need to initiate a refund request from your app which is not correct way and how the app should work please fix it or else I will uninstall your app.

"Uber sucks nowadays. Wrong map, wrong routes, overcharge, wait time always longer than estimate. I wonder why people still use this app. I will change to other taxi apps."
V.good
Not helpful customer service at all.
This app so stupid waste app they don't they cancelled themselves 😡
first the experience was very nice and prices were budget friendly but suddenly the price of the cabs specially the auto prices skyrocketed the auto cab which we used to book for ₹110 to ₹125 now for the same distance its charging ₹170 to ₹220. Huge disappointment. Very very rarely going to use uber in near future.
Best
Worst app. I was having 400 rs coupon but they were still showing the non coupon price. I alived the metro where I was having a seat. But because of there coupon i leaved metro and tried to book metro but then that denied to accept coupon and no response from uber team. The biggest problem was that I was having a trolley and a soldier bag with me and I wasted my 1 hour at out of sukhdev vihar metro station at 11:00 pm night. And we all know that how much delhi is unsafe at night.

"Racist app? I think it assumes my preferred language and nationality based on my browser settings and not allowing me to change them. Especially I cannot change receipt's language, and it is affecting my business tremendously."
"Amazing cars, amazing pricing."
Uber always shows me +100 rs price more as compare to other user. I am just tired of these app. I do have screenshot as well incase you guys don't belive. This is pure extortion of money who is long time customer of uber .
worst app. scam. fraud

Driver very friendly best taxi journey I've had in a long time 1st time I've used Uber will carry on using

Seems to work better now. However placed an order for breakfast. An hour overdue now. What a useless service 😒 starving to death. Oh and they have the check to want me to pay to cancel – I need to go out. Ridiculous.

"Prices are so high, literally not worth paying 80% of price in fees. Id rather risk a DUI. Hope they go under."
Incredibly convenient and easy to use. Let me know who my driver was and exactly he was arriving. Very good experience.

Uber's customer service is extremely poor. I've submitted several complaints about drivers misbehaving and have never received a single resolution. Not worth it given so many great alternatives are available.
"Uber used to be reliable and reasonably priced. unfortunately this has changed, not the apps fault, but the drivers. trying to get anywhere now is a pain, had 4 drivers cancel on me after accepting the ride. one cancelling when they were just at the pick up point. seems the drivers accept and cancel to push up prices as each time I tried to get a new taxi the price had gone up. 3 times the price before I had to use a city taxi costing less!"
Scammers yesterday I was in cradock but got notified that I made a purchase in JHB of R500 so my advice to you all is to remove your banking details on their Uber app they stealing and scamming their customers
Great offers 🫴🏻❤️

I ordered food tonight and my delivery person decided that they were going to deliver it to the wrong location take a picture at the wrong location and then take the food with them and instead of receiving at least a refund for my order I was told that my order was ineligible for refund because there was a picture attached to the order

Nice and attractive
Good App for me

Awesome service better than Co op taxi guarantee on time and pickup

Amazing experience. It's better in countries were Uber is legal. Those countries that consider Uber illegal must assess why people keep using it while being consider illegal (the local taxi services probably are bad).
Good app
Just excellent the drivers attitude and cleanliness of the vehicle 3351 from behala 14no to Wipro more is really a classic service they give

Takes tooo damn long to get a ride on this
Unable to connect to the drivers since months so can't use it anymore
Pathetic service now.
"The app itself is fine. But I think it's high time to kick the non compliant drivers out, especially in Bangalore. This would reduce the traffic and make the service better. The streets are filled with cabs who choose which place they want to go to and not where the customers want. Why do we need uber for this? We had ricks in the past and they also did the same thing. Same Problem, only worse now."
Great expert
Good
"Just found out from the driver that out of $13 fare they only pay the driver $6, no wonder he was mad and driving like a mad man. Uber you need to treat your drivers A LOT better so they can treat us better. Don't tip either uber steals the driver's tips by reducing the tipped amount from their next fare."
Good driving Tamily reached

Excellent service and faster.
I got an uber to the grocery store in the early evening. The store is 2 miles away. Traffic was light and i was by the road waiting for the driver when he pulled up. When i ordered the ride the app quoted the fee at $6 and some change. I use uber often on quick little trips such as this and that was the common price. I paid with an uber gift card and went about my shopping when i arrived i noticed they had charged me $15!! I had no choice but to order uber home. The trip home was $6. What gives
Needs more improvement
it's great for emergency
"The drivers are mostly profeasional.However, I have gorten the occasional crazy driver. Who will steal from you by cancelling the ride or charging you for rides u did not take."
Excellent for travel
"I keep getting connected to drivers who arrive at the correct pickup spot, but wrong SIDE of the pickup spot . I try messaging & calling them to explain my exact location, but they don't understand due to language barriers. Then they cancel. One example: Middle of the night in the RAIN, I had THREE drivers in a row cancel after they arrived. It should not have taken me almost an hour to travel FIVE minutes away. Uber is trash, I'm uninstalling & sticking with Lyft from now on."
Very pleasant and prompt. Kept me up to date on pickup time. Made the experience enjoyable.
Good

"Ненавижу это приложение, я опаздывала на свою работу в которой у меня была презентация моего продукта и именно в тот день моя машина сломалась, решила заказать этот Убер и именно в этот день моему уберу понадобилось моё id шикарно, я опоздала на работу на 3 часа Требуете id обрабатывайте б ляьь быстрее Я все нервы изза этого потратила"
Very good 👍
Pay your drivers more and stop ripping your customers off!!!
Very good
I absolutely love it
I've never had a bad ride!
Reader hatao
Very nice fare and driver super
The driver is amazing
Wastes ur time showing 'finding driver' and fails finally. Very irritating and time wasting
Very nice
Nice man
Great thanks
Great driver
"Edit: Still 1 star, would give 0 if I could, same issues persist. Drivers make you wait, arrive to the pickup point and then cancel, even when you message them where you're headed to the moment they take the trip. Uber One is actually a waste, as it makes drivers cancel more often. Terrible customer service by the way."
The app does not work well I tried to add a 2$ tip it didn't go through so I added to again and now it's a 4$ tip .. I'll leave it be so the driver gets it but I'm not happy.
Perfect at all
There are bugs on the Uber app and there is absolutely no way yo report them! Trying to provide feesldvack on driver that refuses the right address and the app just blows up saying there is no content to display. There is no way to report bugs in the app. Guess they don't really care to improve anything.
Safe driving 👌👌
Nice aap
Ronnie was excellent. Such a sincerely nice guy!!
"Great app, works as it should."
A very good service app. There isn't a perfect app so you take the good and the bad.
"Worst service. , i booked car for an emergency but car not mooved from current place from 20 min. , i called him but didnt pick my call & it happen for twice time for same ride & i am facing this issue every time . driver called you & ask where you want to go then after he cancle or he request for cancle this ride. Drivers are completly shameless. Poor service . I request to uber please close this app"
"Prices continue to climb and are extremely High for no reason. Very disappointed. No customer service to directly rate/complaint/ or talk to anyone about pricing. Uber as a company, terrible. The Drivers are great. Poor company management."
Always great
"If I could give negative rating, I would rather give it. If the driver takes ride from wrong path, and then uber inflates the rates, and there are no refunds for the same. I would rather switch to Ola"
Nice
Good
"It works, magic, love it."
Wonderful!!
Very convenient when you done have a car.
Love this Uber app. Easy to use.
Always in time and good driver's customer service and care.
Drivers should not accept a ride if the rider is 20+ minutes away!! I don't want to wait that long when my ride is only a 7 minute trip.
Nice
Wonderful services
Ok ok he
I will never use Uber again
"Very unreliable when you have to go to work because drivers constantly cancel on you, I've had 3 drivers cancel my ride when I had to be to work and it resulted in me being extremely late."
Wao him so much to you and all your member
Vero necesito person.
Very Bad Servises in Driver's
"foi cobrada uma viagem, mas o motorista não apareceu, como devo me proceder para receber meu credito de volta"
Nice app ❣️
So dependable. Always on time and courteous drivers. Decent prices with extremely clean and comfortable vehicles.
All cars have been clean. And drivers have been pleasant
👍 good
"Don't bother reserving a ride ahead of time unless you like sitting around waiting for 90+ minutes with no explanation and then a threat of a cancellation fee when you give up and make other arrangements, with virtually no chance at contacting their customer service."
"It is a good service, but the app needs some updates. It never shows real time, infact sometimes it doesn't even run time. It doesn't show that the driver is vacant or has a customer. More you will open the app It will increase more charges.😔"
Awesome 👌
NO ME DEVUELVE LA PLATA DE LAS CANCELACIÓNES
Great.
Use Lyft or another app of you can.
حرفيا اسوء خدمة عملا واسوء ابليكيشن ممكن حد يستخدمه بيشغل شوية اشكال عجيبة ومهما يحصل او تعمل شكاوي ولا فايدة حاجة وقعت منك ف العربية ولا حترجعلك ولا حيوصلوك بالسواق الي هو في الاغلب حرامي وقبل علي نفسه حاجة وقعت من عميل لو السواق قليل الادب واسلوبه زي الزفت و مرجعش الباقي ولا من شكاوي بتجيب نتيجة واخر واحد توهني وسعر الرحلة اتضرب في ٢ عشان الاستاذ مش عارف اي حتة وباردو ولا اي تصرف من الادارة الغبية معندهمش حتي خدمة عملا او رقم تتواصل معاه شوية هبل بيردو شبه الروبوت في الشات بفورمات ايميل

"The driver didn't arrive at pick up , didnot pick up call and cancelled the ride . And now I have been asked to pay for the rider. What type of behaviour is this ??"
Not bad...
It's always good to know someone is out to give you a ride for the lowest cost.
Arrived very fast compared to some other competitors in the market
Convenient and affordable

My driver James was fantastic. I have a leg injury & he let me sit up front for easier vehicle access. He's was great!! And a safe driver
I don't know what happen with the uber tonight first they drop me in a wrong location after returning the driver ask more money than uber show me after contacting customer helpline he shouted at me and leave lastly when I book another uber driver came and ask me the location and how much money show in my uber after seeing the amount he said compare to the location the amount is less if you gonna pay me more money I will come or else cancel he said he left me and cancel himself and uber charge me

"The teen account is useless. Neither I nor my parents could turn it off. Above all of that, it keeps telling me that teen trips are not available in your current location. If there were 0 stars, surely I would have chosen it"

Rides are more punctual
Comfortable and offers the best ride in the shortest possible time

Nice work .

"This company thrives on ripping off customers, I cancel rides instantly and still get charged as well as being more expensive than local cab services"
Unfair Business Practices By UBER
"I had Uber cash to use but the app wouldn't let me book/reserve. Their support ghosted me for 5 days. Was able to use half the Uber cash later in my trip and now my balance is zero. So Uber not only doesn't care that their service isn't working properly, they took my funds away. I'll never use this service again. Corporate thieves."
Good
Superb
"The best ride in my life !!!! The driver is an amazing professional and very helpful guy , the car is just fantastic 👏 . Unforgettable experience . Thank you"
I checked two three time that the price is increased when I check the ride and closing app for few time and again price of ride getting 10-15 rupees more .
"I'll start off by saying I have used them for about three weeks and every time I go 5 miles into town it is 22$ to $30. I got on Lyft today and both rides I needed today were $10-13 cheaper. Also you should know that Uber has taken down their customer support phone number, so you will have to deal with a live chat and that's hit or miss ( mostly misses). Hopefully that will help you decide if this app is suitable for you."
"Funcionava perfeitamente uns anos, mas recentemente cada vez mais está tendo demora nas corridas, preços que aumentam todo dia e falam que tem ""vários motoristas ao redor"", mas sempre puxam uma pessoa do outro lado da cidade."
Too good
"Prices have become absolutely ridiculous. Charging almost 50 bucks for a 15 minute ride when it's not even snowing or raining? Beyond robbery, i only use when there's some type of deal now."
Over monetised taxi app and food delivery app with alot of fees.
Uber is bad
it's always quick waiting for a ride sometimes it can be more expensive than Lyft not much to say about the app to be honest since the drivers do all the work . I guess the only thing you can rate Uber for is how quickly they match you with a driver the rest is on the drivers service but overall I like it.
"Absolutely tired of ghost charges, they take every opportunity to charge your card without you knowing it, it has happened multiple times and it's just not worth it with the current fares"
Good service
Drivers often cancel rides after accepting them. I was stranded at Howrah Station for 45 minutes for this reason. I will not use Uber again.
Excellent

"I have a complaint regarding an incident, you kept closing the complaint yet you havent solve anything yet, reply on my uber thread, dont close the case"
Good day question how can goods be pick up from a company and deliver to a shipping company where I.D. is required to enter to give the package to the receiving company.please advise.
Horrendous business model They price gouge you constantly They cancel your trip many times and ask you to pay more to not have your trips cancelled before a driver comes pick you up Completely horrible greedy behaviour
app shows blank screen when i open it. so annoying and damn near unusable. i can use other booking apps except this one. some uber one perk i guess.
This ener man as soon as I got in his car at my house on the last ride I said did the payment go through and he said yes so I locked my card I've had hackers trying to use my Uber and Lyft my bank cards I can't get in my credit karma I have no emails now . So the line was a tiny bit long not much and I get home check my Uber and was a charge for wainting which I new nothing off I just wanted to make my sure I locked my card and he said nothing about another ride home cost at all and when I Uber
Never have a problem luv yall
im tired at this point and it would take me forever to describe every single terrible experience ive had. most cars smell like cigs and most dont like cracking the window open if suffocating
Very convenient!
"Terribly disappointing to use the app. The fee upon request versus the fee at the end of the trip is so escalated. Further more, if you have the card option payment is taken long before the trip starts or you're even picked up. I will always choose other apps over Uber, extremely unfair on how they choose to treat loyal customers!"

"Great App, very user friendly interface and very easy navigation menus. Also I love the concept of matching rider rating with driver rating which is absent in other Cab hailing Apps. Kudos to the maker of the app for creating such a terrific app. Really love it."
First time with user. Very quick service
Customer support doesn't work. They ignore any attempt of make claim.
Convenient and Cheaper alternative
Best experience I love it
Very good. Help me riding in different places.

Absolutely brilliant couldn't fault them
Great knowing which driver and car are coming and the price is decent
Easy to use and keeps you informed on the status of your ride.
Pay Uber to go around labor laws to get you a ride.

Scooter ride nice journey.
Bekar ... Muje booking ke time alag peyment dikhaya or utarne ke bad usse dubble payment dikhaya ... Mere divise mey same location surch karke zada price ata hai or mere friend ke phone mey same location ke lie car search karke usse 200/300 rupay kam dikhate hai... Sabke pass se same payse nahi late.

There is no button to reverse the route. Should focus more on location accuracy.
It's decent but lately rides takes too long and rides are getting more expensive even with the promos available..sort that issue out and you can expect a 5 star rating.
Excellent service
"I booked a ride at ₹363. The driver took some different route than the one showing in the the app. When I reached my destination, the fare was ₹477. While we were unloading the luggage (which took 1 min), the fare raised to ₹482 and kept on increasing. Why are we getting charged when the driver took the wrong route or even when the cab was idle at the destination. The driver was also very rude. He was not accepting that he took the wrong route and was blaming us."

At first uber was the best app to use for traveling but nowadays rider charge more money from the real charge. Rider behaviour towards traveller is very bad.
Good ride
"Every time I get a list of cars to choose from with some soecufic puckup time (eg 3 minutes). Every time after selecting the car I get different car with a completely different time. No explanation, nothing. Sometime the pickup time significantly changes several times. That sucks. Getting a local Taxi is way more reliable."
Great app
Muito bom ainda mais em situações de extrema urgência
Bakwas
Love you Uber
👌
Very good 👍
It keeps on showing u the error message if you have the free ride. The worst experience ever.
I only have two problem with Uber and that's is how far away the drivers are and the route they take because that I'm always late to work.
"I don't have to use Uber that often but when I have it's been hassle free, easy to use with no issues. Driver are nice. Some are more talkative than others but that's fine with me. Sometimes I have to take my dog with me and the drivers are cool with it as long as you order a ride that says it's for pets, or you send message to driver ahead of time to allow them to choose the ride or not. I bring a blanket so he doesn't mess up their seats. so far it's not been issue.Uber is cheaper than lyft."
Good
Super no extra payment
Rate is high but rides are ok
Navigation is worst..
"Wait times are too long, and drivers drop you unexpectedly. They give you a shorter wait time and then deceptively give you a longer wait time."
"worst experience with uber, very slow app Cab driver are fraud"
Fentastic

The best cab aggregator in India. No doubt. I have always had a great experience with Uber compared to other services. Yes there are annoying drivers and random cancellations which is out of Uber's capability but the service is top notch.

"Disabled account with no explanation. Cannot log in since 10 June with no replies to my emails or help requests. Missed a call on the 10th of June because I was in class and tried to follow up with no reply since then. No customer service line I can access - only the one in-app according to the voicemail. Disappointed and this is the last resort for me to get help. Otherwise, I unfortunately have to look for alternatives."
"Worstu app... I completed my ride 5 hours back, still the ride is showing active.... Tried contacting the driver and customer service.. All went vain... Uninstalling the app"
Driver extra charge ki demand krte h
Use it everyday to get to work. Very dependable
Super decepcionado una carrera que normalmente siempre pago en la app con ustedes entre 3500 y 5000 pesos colombianos y que queda a 2km en hora tarifa dinámica se sube a 12000 y 15000 no tiene lógica y aparte que uno mira y todo el día es tarifa dinámica según ustedes no abusen con las tarifas.
👍💜
Nice one
"Worst experience. For cancellation you need to be pro. First cancel button is hidden in dots. And after efforts when you open the menu to cancel, just once click will not cancel it. There is one more click. After 1st click, i thought it is cancelled but it was not and i was charged Rs 76. No place to raise the greaviouns on the app. If there still cannot find."
Very nice
👍👍👍

love uber so much cheaper Nd better than lyft
"Review for eats part of app: Some parts of the app are good. Other parts are not. For example, my order arrived no problem, it was easy to order, could see the driver on GPS, all good. I was given the option to rate my order but I hadn't had a chance to check it yet. I sat down to eat, found problems with my order, went back on the app after I finished and the option to rate was gone. I also couldn't get a receipt. Not good."

"My money was taken for scheduling a ride, which wasn't delivered. I requested for a refund. It's more than 3 weeks now, no refund, no money on my Uber cash, the customer support on the app keeps archiving my messages when it has not resolved. Three different chats have been archived concerning this matter and they are so nonchalant about it."

"After all these years and experience and monopoly acquisitions, you'd expect uber to be much better."

Sometimes the waiting time is too long that makes one wonder on why to use this app👎👎
"In Dec 2024, Uber/driver overcharged us with extra $35 fee for ""Rerouting Fee"" on top of the original $45 fare, AFTER 1 or 2 days after the ride was taken. This is very shady & dishonest & theiving practices from Uber! And no way to dispute this extra late charge inside the uber app. We sent a message to uber customer support and no responses at all. We are considering chargeback dispute with credit card company, and NEVER use Uber again for our taxi/rideshares in future."

At first I was under the impression that my phone model is too old and maybe didn't support the latest updates but now I have a later model and the interface is still not like before, and compared to my partner's iphone it still looks like the old interface, why did you downgrade the experience on Android?"

"This is the biggest scam I ever seen and how is this legal is extremely concerning. You book a ride, choose a pick up point and pay for it. Then Uber or the driver picks out the pick out point instead the one you choose and because you are unaware and confused and you are checking the app to see where the driver is, if the driver has to wait for more than a minute the driver will cancel your ride. So you pay and Uber gets your money and you don't get a ride. This people should be in jail."

Very nice app for daily use
My ride canceled my trip and i pay extra 10 QR because driver canceled my trip .
The best app for rides
Changed my life for the better in ways I'm still finding out about
Very very nice like it.......😍😍
"0 star... On one ride, uber charged me multiple times but they say its just an authorised hold. Its been over a month... Nothing is resolved. Another of my ride failed because no uber available but it still charged money from my account and the ride is not even on order history so I cant even get help TT. Uber scammed me of ~$60 (incl uber eats failed order). So I'm going to be petty and rate 0 star + delete app even if there is $5 credit 🙃"
I am verry happy ❤️
When we booked it the price shows us 81 ruppees and when we reached our destination it is showing 135 ruppees then driver told us that the amount is 135. But in our mobile ti is still showing 81 ruppees. We trust uber . But they always betray us and take more money. And they delay too much.
Really good apps
Good
Worst App alway uber diver first confirm it and say I will not go...and they cancel it ...uber diver charging 3xtra money and saying cancel it give me cash then I will start u'r trip 😤
"Never again! I was in a rush and booked a taxi through this app. When the driver arrived and saw my luggage, he canceled the ride on the spot. To make matters worse, I was charged an 8-euro fee for a trip that never happened. This app is not just unreliable but also unfair, wasting both your money and your valuable time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it completely. Truly the worst experience I've ever had!"

Charged me $5 for app bug

Rates are more than rapido
Fraudulent claim being made and the support is not helpful. What a scam.
Good
Maximum drivers are cancelling the scheduled trips without informing the customer.... It is creating huge mess while going for boarding a train or a meeting.... Moreover Uber is charging cancellation fee while drivers are cancelling the trips from their ends.

"Wait time is too long, nonsense app"
"Uber shuttle was booked in advance but after waiting for tracking almost when the expected time for arrival is over. I got a message that we had to cancel the trip from uber shuttle. What the hell , can't you guys handle a simple booking. I had to get an ola ride after this paid 1000rs yeah right I had to bookola ride. Because your uber ride is not anywhere near me available. So much time just to book it. I'm so annoyed with your app uber."
Super ride
What's wrong with Uber???? Highly disappointed with the service. Their rides keep cancelling and they take so much time to give a ride. After using Uber for so long this is not expected. Need to move to other options as well.
Very nice service
After getting PiN and drivers confirmation..driver cancells the ride...pathetic
Great experience with Uber. It save time and money
Pleasant drivers - they never fail to have a good conversation.
Great trip
"Great driver. Love her to death. I've ridden with her multiple times. Made great conversation and music was amazing. There are only 2 issues. 1, she has incredibly bad rode rage, and 2, She one time dropped me off and then called me the next day, saying she doesn't remember taking me home and getting home herself. For these reasons, I'm giving her 4 stars. (Would have been 3, but the road rage is actually quite comical to me, so I gave her 4.)"
"Muy buena aplicación para transportarse, es muy efectiva, fácil de usar, con buena interfaz, muy cómoda y útil, la recomiendo bastante"
Good work
"Waited for 1 hrs to connect a driver but all I vein, worst service, just drivers are disconnecting the ride"
Good but sometimes the amount shows too high.
"Long delay in booking, additon of tips is really disappointing"
"I have to use Uber to get to and from work. It's stupidly difficult to budget in enough rides for the week when every single time I use it, the app authorizes my card twice. You sank my bank account into the red and now I have to walk in the below freezing temperatures to get home. Screw you."
"The pick up time offered always doubles or more after you commit to a ride. If you cancel because of this you are charged a cancelation fee. Fraudulent. When the time doubles, the price should drop. Just tried to book another ride that said 3 min pickup. When I selected it, it immediately became 14 minutes. Thank God for Lyft!!!"

Good Experience
Worst app ever. Fake numbers of drivers are provides which never gets picked. And when you try reaching out for a long time they start charging you fine.

This app is very inconsiderate. Sometimes it ups my Uber price $20 and they do not care whether you have it or not

They make it hard if not impossible to cancel your ride as I have made other arrangements. Still don't know how to cancel my ride.
Bast cab booking app
"Uber employs drivers who SCAM passengers by claiming to pick them up and dropping them off at weird destinations. I recently bought this to Ubers attention but they were quite dismissive. As this is the 2nd time it has happened to me and I have been a long time user of this app, I feel that I need to warn the public."
I have been. Using uber for cabs and most of the times I get the cab on time. It's very easy to use and helpful.
Baar baar OTP mangta hai bs
"This is praveen, yesterday 15 dec, I booked uber car to go indira park from vanasthalipuran, while booking they showed 147 rs, but at end they charged 220rs, and again return in evng the cab driver used bad traffic route, he took 1 and half hr time to reach my destination, and charged 470 instead of 220 he took more than 2 rounds unnecessary at zindatilismath road, while I am saying this is not correct route, any have very bad experience with uber yesterday"
Good
So I got charged $18.49 for a trip I didn't even take. I canceled it due to UBER taking too long to find a driver. I disputed the charge and was refunded a $1 and some change which left a charge of $17.07. From my understanding I thought it was a charge of $5 for a cancelation fee.

Very good.

Way more extra fees than doordash and if order is wrong they will do nothing to resolve or compensate
Use this app if you want to get hacked
Waste app cheating app pick up 15 km dropping 20 km i get 252 only i not get free cng or petrol 😡😡😡

rename this app to "cold food". They route delivery guys for a quest through the whole city. Their delivery time twice slower than any other app and it's with uber one enabled.
"Worst experience, we'll book for some location and if they don't want to go, they'll intentionally make us wait and cancel the ride."
Love it
Un golazo
Very rude behaviour of drivers. They continually force customer to cancel the ride so that customers and don't even help the customer also.

This app is really helpful for emergency propose
"Uber eats charge me when I canceled my order, canceled because my order showing me 1 hour late and driver keep getting changes. I already waited 1 hour for this order, and Uber showed me an order late for another hour. After I canceled my order, Uber charged me the full amount of orders and split it with the store and driver. Shame Uber eats, steeling money. Do not order with Uber eats. Order DoorDash or something else."
It was great
App crashed often... Predominantly using LYFT now
Driver was on time very courteous and friendly. Had good coversation and very helpful and bit pricy for a 3 mile ride though
Good service
"Uber Car Seat will cause you and your child to be straneded if you need round trip! Why would you offer this one way especially to an airport?! Request Uber Car Seat to get around New York, Los Angeles, Orlando, San Francisco, Miami, ***Washington D.C***., or Atlanta with your child safely buckled up. For children 5 - 65 lbs. Child eligibility Nuna RAVA seats are not currently available in Uber Car Seat rides in*** Washington, DC.****"
"App will allow you to reserve a ride from home to airport with a (child) car seat. Then you go to reserve the ride from the airport to home and (child) car seat is not an option. So... we're going to be stranded? Uber's going to keep our money? Fortunately, I was just researching but it took HOURS to realize it is not possible to take an Uber with car seat BOTH to and from our airport. This is in the DC area. Note on same Uber website says they do and do not offer car seats in DC. Which is it?"
Good
Good captain
"I will not tolerate video ads in this app. Specifically on the screen when waiting for your Uber to arrive. I am already paying for the uber ride, AND I pay for Uber One. Video ads on top of ride fees and a monthly subscription screams of wanton greed for we are not talking about a free website that needs to be monetized, we are talking about ads that don't need to be there and only serve to justicely enrich Uber."
Comfortable and good prices
Excellent
Great
GPS is constantly off.
It's the gold standard.
"Seems to be much cheaper than some competitors away from the city. A ride cost $8.xx with Uber, but would have been nearly $30 with a competitor with the expectation of a 45-60 minute wait."
Always a good driver
Very helpful app for traveling
Very comfortable cab and good behaviour of driver
"I'm looking for the update my card account into Uber Ride but, too bad the systems didn't go through it."
👍 great
"You're a good driver, clean car nice personality"
Charged me for immediately cancelling a ride because the trip began and I wasn't in the car! Pickup times vary wildy (even in a popular metro area) and drop off times are inaccurate. How can you charge me for immediately cancelling a ride when the ride has been started without me? Reporting problems is also a total nightmare. Made me late over and over again. Fuming.

No ride does it better than uber❤️❤️❤️
Terrible service and once was the best now the worst most driver don't accept and drive off once the app says it has arrived. Not even 1 star o star
"Very bad 😞 now I don't like this and don't recommend any one to install this app and your valuable time Their drivers cheat you by cancelling the ride last time and Uber is also taking too much money, Uber charges extra for cash on delivery, anyone should do a very wrong favor, this stupid app don't download this rubbish app ....."
"Very Bad experience the driver will cancel the ride,he himself but sometimes we should wait very much that my son school timings will be over. He should get beating sometimes because of Uber riders. If they accept the ride they will come only little way,and then the driver himself cancel the ride.So I request you to improve the settings of the driver or what is suitable for you to do. Please concentrate on this many people are suffering from this problem."
Very unreliable service
You took money from me and nobody never showed up.
The service is good

Bekar app hai
They always mess up billing or charge me when the driver cancels or fails to show up. I feel like it's not worth using due to the amount of dsputes youll have to resolve.
Very good app
I've been using uber for a few years never had a problem until recently where a driver forgot to end my trip my trip of R41 went up to R202. Tried customer service they didn't even review my situation they still billed me for the trip I didn't take. Highly disappointed.
"Yesterday night, a ride for a 2 mile straight line, driver took a turn at 300 feet and I asked why, he said a different destination, he stopped and told me to edit the new destination, but then the charge will duplicate, I disagreed, he said cancel then, not posible and the the app charged me the full amount for the 2 blocks ride, the driver and I disagreed but not posible through the app, to cancel, dispute or anything, ended up walking alone at almost midnight with a wrongful charge 4 a noride"
Wow
Nice app 🙂
"Can improve delete history as well, sometimes it's needed cause we are booking rodes for our unknown persons as well it's stored under history, sometimes it's unwanted. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Uber is degrading day by day. I'm using uber since a very long time. The bike riders they hire are very rude, abusive and has no ethics. They ask double and triple of the shown fare. I've another account too. Even there I've reported multiple times yet no action has been taken. Do take action against these unsafe drivers who has no manners."
Can't see shuttle packages
"Inconsistant product, orders canceled without any notice, and support refuses to compensate for lost time. I'll be using doordash instead from now on."
Super 👍

It was easy to use the app and the driver arrived early. His car was immaculate and he couldn't have been more courteous. Very pleased

Cancels my order after an hour and a half of waiting. What a disgraceful and rude thing this app facilitates.

"This was my first trip ever with a rideshare app service. It was great- easy to set up, easy to request a ride, easy to pay. Driver was friendly, prompt, & safe. Car was clean. Will definitely use again!"
Very bad design and poor booking experience
Uber is a life saver
Wast of time.... better ola

Nice application
I love this App. As compared to other Apps ride price low.
"I recently faced an issue with fare discrepancies during two Uber Auto rides—while the fare displayed in my app was Rs.103 and Rs.111 respectively, the driver’s app showed higher amounts of Rs.111 and Rs.123, which I ended up paying to avoid conflict. This inconsistency between the rider and driver apps needs to be addressed urgently for a smoother experience."
Economic and Best
Exellent
Too easy for drivers to cancel with no consequence at all. More often than not waiting for 10+ minutes just for drivers to cancel in the end.
"Takes too long to locate drivers or the driver cancels the ride, happening way too frequently, almost all of my last few rides I had to deal with this nonsense"
"I am not able to add upi for uber shuttle, no option available there"
Exilent..
"Precios caros, aumentan su precio dependiendo la temporada, y al ser festiva, aumentan como si realmente valiera tanto andar en taxi, mejor irme en un taxi local."
Best application for booking....🥳I recommend everyone should use Uber..
"Enrique was a great person, enjoyed the ride"
Forcefully asked to give ratings.
Thank you
Worst app ever. Every time when I try to book cab initially it shows less amount and when I book it never books the cab and take too long to book. Second time when I try they increase the fares way too much. This app is pathetic. 1 star is the least I can give otherwise they don't deserve 1 star also.

It's the fact that my money was deducted by Uber from my account without my knowledge.
Love the location tracking.
Good driver
Experience with uber is getting worst with every trip.from past three to four trips they are adding extra money to the initial payment which I have to pay.Sometimes I pay the visible amount after ride end in cash to the driver but still they add extra money for last cash payed trip to the next one and it is getting repeated with every now and then.This isn't the acceptable behaviour for a platform such as uber.
Driver stole my bag and uber did less than nothing. They'll be of 0 help
Nice ret 😉
Always best
Good
Never select payment method as wallet as I found Uber hikes the fare after completing ride. As long as I was using cash payment the initial estimate and final fare were same. The moment I switched to wallet based payment the final fare deducted from wallet was much higher than initial estimate. What AI Uber app is applying to deceive riders?
Too good
Excellent service....fair price
Good
Dude made my date uncomfortable asking for her number and asking if she's free for a date. She reackons she couldn't wait to get out of the car. I'm never requesting a ride for a date for again. Next time I'll stay sober and driver her myself

Uber isiser friendly. Always care for riders
"Hi good day please can you tell me why is it that I only have the option of paying by card, if I request cash it tells me I can't pay cash on the trip and how many times do I need to confirm my identity"
Unable to call driver from user end.
If you search some taxi fares so Uber cut money from your account. I book only one ride and Uber cut two time money from my account 14 pound. I book one trip and cancel within one second then Uber cut my money from my account 7 pound

100% Reservation confirmed.
"Perfect except it connected me with someone too far away once and I was a few minutes late rebooking, but rebooking was fast the driver informed me and I like how much more product offering there is. Competitive with Lyft and doordash combined might just get the premium sub"
Top notch
Good
"It's usually a good experience, but there are times I order an Uber to go to work the driver except my ride then cancells. Today, my driver was 20 minutes out and headed my way. She was 4 minutes away and canceled my ride. Then, I had to wait another 20 minutes for a new driver, which made me late to work. This has happened a few times. If I cancel myself, I get a fee, but if the driver does it, it's no big deal."
"First time riding share, I was the last pick-up and I thought all passengers will go to the one main address which is the airport. We dropped a passenger to an apartment complex in route. I finally made it to the airport."
There was nowhere to change my pickup. Why is there no button to change the pickup destination?

I use like uber but now evertime I use it it takes more then it should be from my bank account just not my uber was $21.85 an right before that it took another $11 dollars like what's up with that? I paid $32.85 for a ride home? Wow rip off I say.
First class service provider in Bangladesh
Good service but can be cheaper
"I was a big fan of Uber until tonight. I booked an Uber home from an event, a price and pickup time were quoted, then no driver was found. Several times, with ever increasing prices. After 45 minutes I got a ride on Lyft (for less than the original price that was never honoured). Uber, if you quote a price, honour it. If that means you have to pay drivers extra, then that's what you should do."
Very pleasant
Provide good service at crowded place also
Absolutely unreliable service of uber autos. They do demand cash. They do not go short distances or very long distances. Cash options selected but app goes for payment to uber.
Good app to book cab
Easy to use and very convenient
Sometimes it Doesn't even book the ride and majorly it takes long time to confirm rides
Uber is a life saver. I use uber mostly for sending packages. Previously a lot of drivers used to cancel trips but nowadays that has decreased a bit. The only thing annoys me when drivers cancel after arriving at the pickup spot finding out it's a package delivery. I always tip drivers who are well behaved and well mannered.

"I was charged twice for one trip. Once for the ride, and again for the ride and the tip. This isn't the first time it's happened, too. It's not the driver or the vehicle, it's the app. When will I get my money back?"
Excellent app. Easy to navigate 👍🏻
App says 2 min wait. Once confirmed it's over a half hour wait. Very inconsistent. Not reliable. Prefer Lyft instead.

"Pathetic experience with cab drivers in kolkata. First none of the accept the bookings. Even if they do, after keeping you waiting for sometime they will cancel your trip leaving you with no other option than to look for other public transport. I have been using uber since 2015 and have never seen such poor service and driver in any other app."
"Takes such a long time to find me a driver, which usually ends for me being late. Also very expensive and laggy"
Mr. Andrei is very respectful He teach me how to check the price since this is my first time. The car is clean. Thank you for the safety. Have a great day always

Very bad facilities. Don't come in time no driver is found every time.
"Uber auto drivers are one of the worst people ever. They dgaf about anybody but themselves. I have to pay extra every time I ride. Paying 20s or 30s is fine but in had to pay 1 70 more to one auto driver. Also you get convenience fee from us when there is wait charge or cancellation but you don't do the same for us when the reverse happens. If you can't use the damn uber cash, then what's the point in having it."
Not user frindly
Good service
Very worst app i ever seen very bad... I was booked the cab from here but when I call the driver than he says that payment will be charged double because this is our services so we will decide the rent not app...am not understand I think that rent and all decided by the cab driver than why this app has been started very third class app
best ehailing app ever
Good
Absolutely unreliable. You might find a ride in a few minutes or wait an hour Drivers cancel for no reason as has happened to me many a time. The last time I tired to use uber there were none and I was struck away from home at 11pm. Havented used it once since then as cannot be trusted. Useful in an emergency but don't rely on it in any way.
Very good
was amazing driver
This is my first ever trip. enjoying the easiness.
Good experience
"It says the driver is 5 minutes away, then assigns me one that is 23 minutes away"
Greatest
"My ride is nice, and correct time punchuallitty"
Good experience
"Surge Pricing based ride shares, and also ads when you're waiting for a ride you paid for. Not kidding: got a full spread Coke ad AFTER PAYING for a ride no less. The ad remained present until the app cancelled my ride suddenly because prices ""went up"" due to demand. Silicon Valley is a pestilence on society."
It was awesome and good app for reaching destination in time
There is no option to skip driver rating. You can not force customer to give rating.
You guys seriously need to fix this. So I transferred $15 out of my savings to get a ride. There were no cars available after waiting for about 5-10 minutes. So I cancel and low and behold there's a driver available. So I go to try again only to find that I can't because $10 has been taken out of my account due to pressing confirm. No money should be taken out until the driver has arrived or in the case of late fees. I shouldn't have to wait for it to be refunded and take more out of my savings
Good
Very nice Uber trip

Better then any other ola or rapido prices are reasonable
I've been doing uber for about five months and I love it

"Shadi mai jana tha bhai ,namkaran tak ho gya paar cab nhi ayiii😶🥲"

"** BEWARE ** Uber application put my location in the wrong place.. the app doesn't let you edit pickup location.. even though I messaged the driver in advance, he canceled and the uber app charged me $6.50 penalty.. when asked to rebook the app charged $15 more for the same ride... uber needs to hire better programmers/ management... what's the sense of paying programmers / management so much for this kind of quality..."

Good experience & reasonable prices but as usual location shows different like always
Uber has helped a lot and very dependable and the drivers are awesome.. Uber gets me to where I'm going 😃
Easy and convenient 😺
Uber does not keep its promises. They gave me an offer to rent a car and get CAD 30 cashback. I followed all the steps and Terms & Conditions as per the available options but never got the promised cashback. When I raised the support ticket they just kept on wasting time and moved my ticket to Archive folder. This is just one incident. There have been many such incidents. I will now shift from Uber and try some other taxi service company which is honest and keeps its promises!
Good rides
"Uber used to be fantastic, but unfortunately these days it can take you an age just to find a driver. It's made worse by the app pretending that a driver is nearby, when actually no one has accepted you."
Good for all
As usually good 👍
Takes too long time to book cabs. Sometimes don't accept.. Drivers prefer cash as Uber doesn't settle amount to drivers on time.
Affordable cost for ride.. Thank you
Amazing ride with low money!
"1. Maps always have issues.its difficult to track the cab. 2. Voucher won't work. App will stop while getting payment from vouchers. 3. Maps will go only via short , unsafe , pathetic roads. 4. Last minute cancellation. 5. Only getting cash payment mode rest is PayPal which support is pathetic."
Good hoh
Excellent 👌👍
Fantastic
"Definitely need to make it easier to cancel orders, additionally youll need another membership to get deals worth it for Eats. Convenient is all that's going for this app."
They charge your card before even getting you a driver so if you try the share option and it doesn't work so you cancel and get another. You end up having multiple charges that you have to go through their refund process to get back which is a nightmare. And they say they'll get you a driver within 3 min try more like 30 if your lucky especially with the share option.
Excellent 👍🏻
Good
High level of glitch everytime I use this app
I need this app to have notifications turned on for ordinary use when I request a ride. It is extremely annoying that you use the notifications to push general purpose advertising for your app. Stop trying to upsell me and just be glad I'm using your app at all.
Nice app

"Great service provider, quick & easy to use."
I've been an Uber driver now for 4 years and that 4 years I've had nothing but good things to say about Uber but this last year I have been treated horrible through them. They would not believe me because I was accuse of drinking while driving. I don't drink. They took my account and blocked me from it until they figured out if I was telling the truth or not. So after this year's up I will be driving away from Uber :/
"Unreliable. App consistently and significantly underestimates times drivers will take to arrive as well as travel time during heavier traffic hours, often making me regret taking transit options that would have been faster. Cannot cancel Uber without significant $ penalty even when driver has cancelled and new driver is far away, driver is going in the wrong direction or driver is clearly parked and sitting in a random spot with no improvement in time. - should have just walked"
Needs a better GPS system other than that it's fantastic
Affadabal price compare to other apps
I used to think this app was a solid 4-5 but over the last two years it has got progressively more expensive and progressively worse and now they are choking driver response to encourage people to pay for priority is just disgusting and literally ringing customers dry when all they want to do is get home.
Perfection
Amazing
"Today i got to know that driver can drop me anywhere even in middle of jungle. So be aware guys with Uber drivers. They charged me full amount. Means he dropped me in half journey. Update: Uber has refunded my amount, good thing but make a feature to report such instances from the app itself at passanger end. This is the first time I have seen that after subscribing Uber one I'm getting higher price quote for same place and same time. 3x the previous original price. Do not subscribe to Uber one."
Great if you want to experience rejection
The cleanest ride with a wonderful driver driver!!!

"Easy to download, easy to use, app works very well."
"Uber support is beyond dismal. They will not remove payment restrictions on my account that should not exist. They charged my card for Uber One for several months, yet declined that same card, claiming it as an invalid form of payment for Rides or Uber Eats. It is the same card they send payments to me for being an Uber driver. Beyond dismal quality of service from Uber and their support team in trying to fix the problem. I will never use Uber for rides or for food delivery ever again."
They charge your card before they even find you a driver then it takes a couple days to get your money back.
Always dependable!
Super
She was amazing. Couldn't of asked for a better experience!
Nagged me for a rating
Wonderful! Great driver.
"It's ok when it works. Not when you've done a good amounts worth of groceries and are stuck outside the supermarket in the cold for over an hour, With silly drivers (all 3) that are more than 2 miles away, then cancel when they get close. I ended up calling a local taxi that got to me in under 10 minutes and cost cheaper than Uber. I also notice how each time the price went further up after each one cancelled."
Easy & fast!
Very prompt got us there on time
Renigunta Railway station is very famous at Tirupati Andhra Pradesh but Uber doesn't show SUV
"Worked well. Driver on time, drove safely, picked up in the right spot, helped with luggage."
Great experience

1st time using Uber. I was pleasantly surprised when our driver pulled up in 5 min.
Better then any other Ride app in Bengaluru i been using it from 1 year.
Very friendly and professional
Great
TERRIBLE DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!! I verified my identity and it said verified complete went to place a order and it asks me for a Facebook to see if I'm a real person and it won't let me go forward with my order.
First time I got good driver in Uber. trust me..he is very calm and hardworking and understand customer situation. I give 10 star. Good Matloob.
Very nice and professional
Very useful! Very convenient having a ride nearly everywhere in the world!

"I only use this app because I can't drive, this app has given me some of the most stressful moments of my life and is responsible for well over $100 vanishing from my account :) I don't recommend using it unless you have to"
"Uber eats canceled order 30 min later with no details. No way to contact support through app. Garbage customer service, will use other services going forward"
Nice app
Good
"Edit: if I get charged if I accept an order and cancel then why don't the drivers. I've had turds more helpful than this app. Literally impossible to get an Uber in London know if you're travelling outside zone 1. Such a joke. Edit: year on and I think it is actually getting worse, now so many drivers cancel after confirming the trip. If I did that I pay a cancellation fee yet if they do it nothing happens."
Very good experience 💗🥰We got impressed☺️
No respect for privacy. There's no reason this app needs a copy of my ID for me to use it. Hugely invasive.
The driver is so detailed and very responsive to time and customer friendly
"Pathetic,"
Low Cost Good Service
"Honestamente el servicio es terrible. Me aceptan viajes choferes para que me me los cancelen o no me hagan caso. Antes el servicio era de primera pero ahora es igual de malo que el servicio normal de taxis que buscábamos evitar. La única razón por la que los sigo usando es por las tarifas relativamente bajas contra la competencia, pero por el pésimo servicio de sus ""socios"", nosotros los consumidores terminamos perdiendo. Al menos dejen reportar a esos socios."
Big rip off use Lyft it's always almost half and good customer service
Because the drive got to me then cancel I still had to pay.
Since the latest update the app requires verification everytime I launch it.
Easy and quick

TIPPING IS NOT FOR THE BASIC SERVICE OF ARRIVING SAFELY & ON TIME!!!!!!!"

"Good clean cars, Polite drivers, Decent price. 1 star less coz sometime its way too difficult to get it booked and sometime if its a terminus drops drivers are greedy and demand extra amt. which ofcource we tend to pay coz we are short of time."
"I am extremely disappointed with the customer support I received regarding a recent trip. The driver never showed up to pick me up, leaving me stranded and inconvenienced. I promptly reported the issue, expecting a fair resolution. However, despite reviewing the trip, Uber still charged me for a service I never received. This is unacceptable. A company of Uber's scale should prioritize customer satisfaction and fairness. Charging customers for incomplete trips is not only unfair but also erodes"

With great disappointment i am writing this that i booked an uber auto number MH03 CT8803 (Rakesh Yadav)for which the driver demanded extra pay also he didn't follow my instructions and took a wrong lane and was very much harsh towards me. This driver was talking on phone with his wife then with his uncle continuoulsy till the trip. Uber drivers weren't like this before and day by day Uber drivers are becoming rude and impolite. Genuine request to uber please look into this matter.
nice 👍🙂 thanks 🙏 Uber ❣️💞
Good service
Unfortunately I have to delete Uber and use Lyft because I cannot contact customer service to address SIMPLE issues like their maps system failing and having me late to work I don't write reviews but since they don't want their customers contacting them I have to leave a review to express my concerns. It's ridiculous and shows what type of company Uber is. But it's not surprising at all considering how they pay their drivers compared to other services like Lyft. Just use Lyft or another app!
"Be careful with those drivers, you never know."
Drivers will make you wait for them but they'll charge you once they cancel the ride

"Uber Moto drivers are really bad. Y'all should have better criteria for choosing Uber Moto drivers. They give absolutely no heed to safety ( one even almost toppled over the bike when I was behind when turning ) and traffic rules or the traffic police. Rapido is far better for bikes. But for cab it's fine, I guess. Tad pricier, but acceptable."
SCAM!! They gave me Uber Cash and still charged my card. The promotions are a scam. Says 0.00 then 3 days later my card was charged. Only bots are available with limited info! Not to mention they change the amounts so its hard to dispute. Uber is only good for one time airport runs. The bank stated they are flooded with Uber disputes.
Good app
Waiting charge is extra bad experience
Its a great way to get round
"I'm a new user and not sure how to ask for specific route nr my home, the map takes a long way round how can you change it."

We had a good ride. Driver was very friendly.

Charged me over 180 dollars in payments and fee despite having vouchers. My tripped showed free while booking only to charge me after the fact

"Worst app ever i have never seen in my life first the take long time to find a driver and it depends upon driver that he want go or not , what is this yaar we are paying you what you are offering to us and after all what we get nothing you have to fix that thing"
Most safest rides i can get
"I use Uber for when my rides fail me. As long as I have Wi-Fi or Mobile Connection, the App works well. The Graphics are great. There are choices for Rental, Ride, Package Delivery, or Uber Eats."
Sometime driver is not understand location and after drive call and talk please cancel the ride ...to much problem face.

"Scam app change money every time, increase amount after reaching destination all the time"
"This used to be the smart, cheap alternative to cabs. The prices have now doubled or sometimes tripled since 2021, and they add a new predatory price gouging tactic, like surge pricing and increased fees for cabs to arrive a few minutes quicker, every few months. They've become a prime example of en****tification in the tech industry."

After that I booked again and the nexxt driver pick the ride when already having customer in his taxi, and keep increasing the waiting time. When I called him he yelled that I have customer with me , I cancelled the ride. Because of this incident I got late 30 min for airport. Uninstalling the app now."

Last time I rated this app in 2020 it was 5*. Unfortunately 4 years later the service is far from ideal. Big issues with getting a ride accepted so drivers can ramp up the cost. Plenty of occasions where drivers accept and then cancel. I've even had a drivier cancel on me whilst on the street I was on! Uber need to do something to address reliability issues.
Good
Fraud Drivers are mostly frauds Uber ask for a specific payment Drivers earn on laugage
"Worst app to book a cab. There was a glitch in their app. I had paid the drive via cash but that same extra amount got added to my ride. Hence, I had to pay extra money for my ride. There's no resolution from their side yet. It's been days reaching out to them. Please use Rapido in india, their customer support service is superb unlike uber where they don't even bother to understand the issue."

"Uber was my favourite and have used it extensively for short and long distances but for the past some months it has become like one of the other apps in its category. The rates are on the higher side, the new promotional emails and notifications are fake, they don't actually provide discounts as claimed in this promos. The drivers are somewhat weird, one such driver stood at an incorrect location & waiting charges was billed."
Unable to confirm ride. I have tried several times to book cab. In the map the vehicles are shown nearby my location. When I choose the type of ride it shoes a message that something went wrong. And ask to reload. I have reloaded several times and even updated the app. Then also the issue exists . FIX THIS ISSUE URGENTLY

They have a pin on delivery system, but when I asked for a refund they say the driver left it there. With what pin?? I never entered the pin to get my order yet I paid for it. I'll not be using any services from Uber or Uber eats going forward. Sies 🤮🤮🤮🤮You guys are disgusting. If I could give a 0 I would have."
Great
The best thing is that they have an highly active customer support unlike Rapido. The prices are also well reasonable with good drivers.
Qaulity cars and very professional drivers. Uber offers very good safety for passengers. The prices for rides are very reasonable.
Unprofessional at all..I paid for a trip I Didn't even take and this is the second time because I used my card..I use my card to be safe not so that they can take advantage of Me.their driver didn't end trip and they took money from my card..I complained and still they did nothing Totally unacceptable I'm pissed off with uber

"Shocking - long waits, driver cancelling after waiting for their arrival all the time. I'm close to CBD. People can't drive"
Wonderful
Exhorbitantly expensive. The uber fees charged are just insane. Sad these stuffs are not regulated by a regulatory body.
Todd was an Excellent driver and I would recommend him to anyone would would like a chill and understanding ride while enjoying a calm easy going atmosphere
"The driver accepted the trip and marked me as onboard even though I didn’t ride. I waited in the street for 10 minutes until he canceled, and I was charged 29.43 EGP by mistake and since the uber removed the section that I can make report note to the driver I couldn't retake the 29.43 egp that he take from me"

Why can't I see distances in km ???? How to remove these bloody miles without messing up with my phone settings ???

I waited for more than 45 min for one of the drivers who accepted my booking only to be called up at the end and told that he will not be taking me . Worst part is that I saw him driving the car in front of me .. He looked at me and drove off fast and cancelled the ride
Hassle-free ride to BER!

"I had an experience just this week where I had my ride pre booked to reach my workplace with uber for 11.15am. The driver called me at around 10.50am and confirmed that he was on his way and that I should wait. Since he was hardly 20min away, I agreed to wait. I waited for driver till 11.40am just to realise he was not going to arrive. He didn't answer the call, neither did he reply to my texts, neither did he start moving towards pick location. I missed my meeting coz of this."
Very Good
very nice
Prompt service at cheaper rate
Best price
I had a very bad experience with Uber today.My uber account showed 170 inr but the auto driver charged double the amount. When I report the issue to event they told they cannot do anything. Worst solution I suggest everyone to opt for online payment and avoid such a scam.
Too much time taken to book ride
😊
Great experience riding an auto to destination...
A safe ride home and the driver even got out to open the trunk on this last ride. I can totally do it again
Good
Nice
Very good trip on time and very cooperative driver
Good
"Sometimes we wait for a driver and at the end they cancel our trip. Today, after accepting my request, a driver cancelled my trip after 25 minutes of waiting. A driver should not have any cancellation option after accepting any request. Uber should change its rules to avoid such time waste of customer"
"The worst. Waited for over an hour at Hobby airport. First assigned driver immediately flaked. Next circled the airport 3 times before he flaked. And I waited. While at least 50 drivers picked up passengers & left with passengers. The messages I received from Uber went from don't worry, there are plenty of drivers in the area to please be patient we'll update you when we can. Seriously? My driver also circled 3 times but was smart enough to call me to find out how to find me! 1 HOUR @ 10pm"

Took money from account with out permission this is a fact

Extremely heavy interface compared to Ola and Rapido...

I am totally exhasuted today...previous some bookings drivers not available but today i am in urgency i booked the moto 1st one attend and cancel immediately 2nd one accept and on the way after waiting for 5 mins he also cancel the ride without any information 3rd one also attend and cancel immediately...i can't expect this...i waiting the location for past half an hour to book a moto...you guys thinking your price will get more customers. It not it only depend on how you give the service.
I am not able to book another trip when one trip is on..!!
"Clear, concise directions and easy to follow instructions."
Very nice person
"Worst app ever i experienced,so much disturbing , and customer service is toooo bad they never help you. Always the fare prices increase on destination 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 RAPIDO IS MUCH BETTER"
"Arriving time & driver quality is was good earlier. But, now, they are taking more time to arrive at pick up location. Sometimes, drivers are denying drive after arriving at pick up location if its at railway station or their unwanted location. They will wait to cancel drive from our mobile so that they will earn as cancelation charges from our pocket!!"

Extremely disappointed I've been trying to contact someone all day my Uber charged me 42$(for a 5 min ride btw) when I was only supposed to be charged 10$ their phone died why is it so hard to talk to a real person this was money I barely even had to get to work so I'm very frustrated and can't even eat now because I'm very tight on money and that's what I was going to use the next few days so thanks Uber for your terrible service as a long time customer I'm extremely disappointed

Works great. Prices fluctuate for seemingly no reason sometime but waiting will make them drop. Love it
Great experience!
Always there when I need it. We have used for rides and eats. Thank you for being there.
Very safe
Excellent and friendly!

The app is fast and informative. We have had great drivers for all 3 times we've used this app. One trip we chose to cancel because the driver appeared to be stuck in traffic.
Uber used to be so reliable and a great feeling of always having a backup of getting home when out late. Past few years it has been extremely poor and you're often left stranded with driver cancellations in abundance. Will be looking for alternatives now for sure.
First time utilizing the service. It's easy and the ride was fantastic.
The driver was an exceptionally kind and great driver.
it's disgusting to see a $15 trip jump all the way to $30 and sometime $50 to attract more drivers when I've been told the drivers don't even see most of that money flat extortion
Always having issues and customer service is useless. They literally ended the chat on me today without helping.
"Gone to garbage, support nonexistent, no payments work despite all working just fine, I call my bank i And I'm told ubrr declined the payment, so I try to talk to support but who do I talk to, a FAQ?"
Mr. Samuel was very professional and we felt safe.
Won't stop at 8 Spadina street Toronto. Not sure why.

"Siempre está en modo ""alta demanda"" independiente de la hora que sea. Aparte siempre dura más de 20 minutos para que un conductor tome el viaje, osea tras de cobrar más caro, cuesta encontrar conductor."
Jacked up the prices. Not worth it anymore.

Arrived when they said they would. Excellent service
Not to bad easy to manage. All the drivers i have had are very independent and courtesy.
Rude drivers. He didn't want to take 4 people even if in the application was clearly specified that it was a trip for 4. I couldn't message anyone at support about this issue

"Exceptional information is given about the location and arrival time to your puck up. Also, live updates as you're on your trip. The app keeps you aware of your entire trip."

"El servicio es cada vez peor, más de una hora para conseguir un viaje por un monto superior a 100 pesos, pésima aplicación, fue la pionera pero se quedó extremadamente atrás en comparación con sus competidores"
"""plenty of drivers nearby"" somehow equates to a 30 minute wait for a 4 minute ride? What the hell is wrong with you?"
Very fast and very good drivers
Good driving
"It should not be possible to have a driver 20+ minutes away accept your ride, then to top it off with a $5 cancellation fee when the drive hasn't even moved 1/4 of a mile. I'll stick with Lyft if I can. Edit: thought I'd give Uber one more chance and reserved a ride, the driver was not at my pick up point and when I called them, they said they were on the way to what was supposed to be my destination to pick me up."

Igual lo tomé por las prisas, pero ahora me cuesta contactar a soporte sobre esto. Todo es relacionado a que el driver hizo algo mal o el precio mostrado por taxi era el correcto. El conductor fue bueno, fue error de la app."

It would be nice if you know it didn't take anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour and a half to get a ride that takes 10-15 minutes
"La app es segura, los conductores son amables y puedo compartir mi ubicación a mi mamá."
"Works great for me when I need it. I'm not so great with the controls, hence the 4 stars, but I still manage to get a ride to my destination."
"My company encourages employees to use Uber, but my last two experiences with drivers in multiple cities have been so negative, that I think I'm going back to taking cabs. Drivers without trunk space for luggage, dirty cars, broken AC, cluttered seats...I don't know if the standards for drivers have been relaxed, but it's no longer a reliable service."
Great experience as always
Pésimo Horrible
Was charged tonight for a car that did not arrive at specified location
Using this app made me have an existential crisis. Genuinely believed that machines may have taken over.
Love it makes it much easier to get around
Baisse de qualité trop importante. Je supprime mon compte et passe à la concurrence.
Wonderful ride. Anthony is a kind person enjoyed hearing about his love for cooking during the drive.
Fast and reliable

"Today i booked a ride and it showed a reasonable price,all the way to the destination the price stayed the same but immediately when i arrived at the destination, the price increased almost double to what it showed when i booked the ride"

Can somebody plz look into the operations. Timing is all wrong. Disappointed with the GPS settings of the drivers. Utterly disappointed with the Uber in the UK. Somebody pls look into it.
Leaps and bounds better then lyft!!!

Last week I requested a ride to a nearby train station because it was late & I didn't want to wait for a bus. The driver picked me up and when he was supposed to turn left he didn't even when I told him to. He drove to a dark an isolated location behind a major hall and told me to get out. I argued with him this was not my drop off and he called 911. Just then I noticed the security o car pull up- it's designed like a police car. I believe the Uber driver had other intentions but was spooked.
"This was a horrible experience. The ride I finally got was good, but I ended up waiting a full hour in the rain because the two previous drivers went to the wrong address. I can't figure out how this happened. It is my residence and there is a big sign at the top of the driveway."

Thank You very much Uber I run straight Uber and please set your preferences the way you like to drive and quit shaking Requests they are sent to you for convenience, distance, price,and a couple other important reasons. You make our wages go down when you are gumming the system up because you don't like the #'s on Request but your the cheapest driver for Uber to send (+×all)"
"Reliable and safe. Difficult to cancel after accepting promos if a monthly renewal exists. Drawn-our support response periods. Ex. I have been trying to cancel for 3 weeks and have only received 1 support response in that time period. I requested cancellation November 21, and today is December 13. Cancellation is still not processed and I have been charged for this cycle."

"Charged 10e for cancelling a taxi that never showed up. Got it back but I had to chase it. Customer service wouldn't verify me after I confirmed all my details but Uber system was not able to confirm my star rating! Customer service delaying me on the phone, dragging out the conversation so I couldn't book another taxi. Already late by this time. Definitely scrooged this christmas. I couldn't rate the driver that didn't show up either which should be an option."

There has to be a better way to get in touch with your driver after you leave things such as a phone in their cars. I lost a side job and money due to the fact I didn't have my phone for 4 hours. Please fix this to make it easier to retrieve our items left in uber vehicles.

Very bad service always increase fare
"Set up Uber 1 through a credit card where I was supposed to get the service free through credits, and they changed my billing card because I used a different card one time. Ended up paying for a ""free"" service for over a year. Scam."
"Uber support is garbage, slow response times and as if they purposely delay responding when it's time sensitive to cancel an order or something of rhat sort. Purposely making it difficult to cancel orders"
Very poor customer services and don't have any proper contact details.
Superb experience with uber . Thank you .
It's convenient and easy to use. It'd be great if there's an option to alert the drivers about the client carrying a dog before sending the request.
"The address function on the Eats tab sucks! Every time I use the Eats option, it removes my address and unilaterally puts me at an address 15 minutes away, where I have never been. Which means I have to change the address back, and delete the mystery address. Every time. Then, when I place an order while at the correct address, the app notifies me that I ""appear to be far away from this address"". Every time. I have repeatedly called customer service about it, and they just have no answers."
"Best support ever. No reply for 3 days. Guys, if u get in trouble , don't expect anything from them!!"

"Dear Uber, Thanks for your email. But to be honest, I'm done with your app. I paid for my ride, but when I tried to book my return trip, your app kept asking me to pay again. It was insulting. I had to download Rapido and book my return trip with them. And you know what? I'm not coming back to Uber. Your app failed me, and I don't want to deal with it again. Don't bother sending me any more emails or offers. I'm done."
"Everytime I get this requested by the app is because they been slacking, lately all the cars I get connected to are really old, really dirty and the drivers very rude, I have tried to give this fb directly but haven't had any luck getting it thru, so... Here I am, hopefully I get better, luckily is not the only option."

App isn't working at all. It shows "no network" even though that is 4g network 😑. It was working fine before the new update.

"The app does not give an option to select petrol driven cabs. Though we asked for a saloon for airport drop off, a vehicle with gas cylinders turned up, with no boot space for our luggage. We refused the drive but Uber imposed a fee. The booking was done by my daughter in law's brother. Consequently our airport drive was delayed. Can Uber explain this?"
Very convenient and Trust worthy.
good & friendly
Very good 👍
"Absolutely a bliss and safe and comfortable. The driver was friendly, knowledgeable and drove carefully with is package! THANK YOU."
Best cab service
"You all charged for a rental a few weeks ago in which we were under the impression that the rental would drop off at our house, but instead, we apparently were supposed to be at New Castle Delaware in which we wouldn't had made the time either way. So why do you think I needed a rental because my truck was in the shop for the weekend. So, how was I supposed to get to the pickup spot. Meanwhile, you all kept $130.00 that really sucks because I rented another car the following day."
"Drivers repeatedly cancel to wait for surge pricing. Company was enough of a scam as it was, now does not even provide the service it advertises. Do not recommend."
Very good
"Uber is stupid and it sucks, is ordered an Uber 6:45 to get to work by 7:30 they not only didn't assign me a driver they kept delaying my arrival. Like are they stupid? I'm supposed to be at work by 7:30 and you're telling me ""no because Uber app is inadequate we will drop you off at 8"" Are they really stupid atleast other driver services reach you on time Update: 12/13/2024 Even more problems have arised what happened to them? The recent reviews are soo bad wow even my recent experince with"
Never used Uber until today and it was so very easy. I could track the driver on a live map and send him a message too. My driver was polite and friendly. Very pleased
Worst app. Just playing by it's monopoly. One would wait for the driver for 5-10min just to get cancelled after that waiting time. Absolutely a time waste.
wait time is always 4-5 times more than the shown one
Don't use this app for the bookings of cab. WORST app for your ridings. Initially it shows some charge but after completion of ride the CHARGE INCREASES around 40%-50%.
"Good for going to places you know well, but often makes navigation errors such as making your driver do an illegal turn, or dropping you physically very close to your ""dropped pin"" destination, but on the wrong side of the river..."
"Uber's ""help"" options on the app are so rigid as to be useless. The app asked me to take a shared ride with no indication that the wait time would be 11 min instead of 2. I accepted it in a moment of temporary insanity, then saw the wait time, cancelled, and then was given an UberX with a 14 min wait. No choice but to accept. Then the Uber driver drove past the pick-up spot and took another 7 min to get back. Ended up being late for a specialist appointment that I should have been early to."

"It's not often that I have to dig through the internet to find out how to get support from a company. Not only that, but the support I received was next to useless. To be specific, I reserved a trip in advance and got charged to my card, when I had at least double the amount available in uber cash, and has opted to use it. I attempted to rebook, but it didn't go through and still deducted from my uber cash. Support team on twitter was pretty useless and gave generic answers. Terrible experience."
Still require updation in accuracy on map
He left me 200 m away from the destination at th railway station
Is very easy app & very low riding price effort app. I am very happy. Is very smart navigation fast. Driver very smart & good behaviour for us.

"Unable to use this garbage dont waste your time, requesting a ride then they ask for photos of your id then they want to connect to your facebook then they want your credit card numbers just to prove its you and after all that you still cant request a ridebecause they just ask you for it again. Usless, utterly usless trash app."
Best city Ride!

I have a voucher yet I cannot apply it and use. Useless app and customer service
"Offered me a 45 dollar credit to renew my account. Not only didn't credit me, but their help department keeps giving me the run around. Do yourself a favor and download Lyft."
"Great, though the notifications become annoying"
Good

Got me to work on time
Good Service

खूप सुंदर ऑटो सर्व्हिस
"Too bad experience, the drivers which I have book are calling and negotiating the price. Even after negotiation they are asking for extra pay for language. Mainly they are saying for arrange the return trip - why customer should"
It's nice but prices iko negotiatable
A consistent pleasure with Uber drivers when a lift somewhere is needed!
"It's fine, drivers often cancel and cause surge charges because they're gaming the system that frankly uber broke taxis to create, hurting everyone else more, and there are too many picky drivers (all often underpaid by uber), BUT it gets you from a to b eventually most times so like it's not a 1, you know"
Paid 70p to STOP silly notifications but still I get them
Great app! Very user friendly. Great job UBER.
"please check my previous package was purchased in 13th nov and it was valid until 13th dec with 4 trips left , by which bata more to pride plaza hotel 3 people ride was booked with the package, then why 540 rs payment is asking?"
This is a bad app when you have renew you card details and if you click option to pay with a different card it will keep promptings you to enter details which means you are ordering multiple drivers and if you are not quick enough you will be. Charged late cancelled fees
👍
What's not to like?
"App is great ,drivers are not ,I was trying to get a uber for more than 20 minutes with the normal price what shows on screen they don't accept until you are booking with higher prices sometimes they are double the prices"
"Drivers keep cancelling to raise the fee. Sometimes, drivers will cancel when they get to your location."
Hanging issue
"I had a terrible experience while booking a cab with Uber. Despite showing available drivers, my ride requests kept getting canceled, and I faced significant delays. The app's estimated arrival times were highly inaccurate, and there seemed to be no accountability from the drivers. To make matters worse, customer support was unresponsive and did not provide a satisfactory resolution. This was frustrating and inconvenient, and I hope Uber addresses these issues to improve their service."
Very good Service 😃
Poor. Extra charges adding to the bill by the app.
He is very good driver
Super
Such a nice guy
"5 drivers within 1 minute on map, none accept but a driver 20 mins away accepted. Worst part is he was delayed by 20 minutes getting to the pickup place. 40 mins waiting for a 5 minute trip. Only wasted my money on this because it was a hospital appointment."
Uber has the worst GPS I have ever seen. Drivers are better off looking on a paper map or following the stars. Every single day I watch my drivers go in circles around me near and far. Pass me up to go to a dead end where it reroutes them further away. It is an utter embarrassment and something needs to be done.
very good aap... 100%
Dope
worst not getting connected and drivers asking double the charge. waste of time and money. no quality.
Op
Good platform
Phenomenal
"Why I had to pay for cancellation fee when the driver itself cancelled the ride. This is not the first time they're charging me for cancellation. Worse app ever, OLA is much better than Uber"
مريحة وهادءة

Nice App
They charged me just because they cancelled a trip :/
Best cab and affordable price
Amazon
Price is affordable
"Cannot reset my account, it keep asking for authentication and support doesn't respond to my inquiry"
App is designed to make it difficult to request refunds in some cases (even when the case is obvious - e.g. rider wrote on the chat that he has no intention of picking me up).
Very friendly and cautious

I can't complain 😎

"after the end of the ride , when I was getting off, I saw that the driver rated me with 1 star , although I was not late nor done any thing wrong which made him rate me 1star, every uber driver does this after the end of ride , such a nonsense act of drivers in Uber ! Would never travel in Uber every again"
Very helpful
"I haven't seen an app worst than this. Drivers are rude, they constantly cancel rides, they talk rude and often company does absolutely nothing about this. Please prefer Rapido or Ola over this app, you'll thank me. DO NOT USE THIS PLATFORM. I would've given it a minus review if that was possible."
بيتأخر اوي على ما تيجي عربية وفي الاخر ممكن يلغي بعد انتظار اربعين دقيقة والموقف اتكرر كتير

Terrible app there is never any drivers available this app should not be relied on for travel drivers never turn up
Waste and very too frod app
Ok
Good
Very Uber comfortable ride
Good for travel
While booking a ride showing some amount after accepting the ride it is showing extra double amount which is not fair enough please try to make the same amount for driver and passenger so that there will not be any glitch
Best drive
"Really clear and easy to see the price, where your driver is including REG number"
Pickup Location Are Everytime Problem
App is better but the drivers are all asking extra amount before picking customer it will be the most disappointing for me.
Service is great except that tonight I accepted a ride that was 3 minutes away and it then turnedvton7 minutes.
"Very poor service, now when you book uber pool, no more discounts wand waste of time for nothing!!"
On time no one taking pick up

Very bad app.. drivers also have no manner to talk..
Good work for uber
Good
Super
Worst app! I urgently needed to go to a place and first I wasn't able to find a driver. When someone accepted the ride the driver cancelled after 5 minutes. It's so frustrating! Worst app. There is no proper customer care services and the prices are also very high. Edit: Today I had to wait for 20 minutes. At last the driver cancelled the ride and I got late. If a customer cancels the ride he/she has to pay charges but drivers don't need to pay any. WHY??
Excellent driver. Very friendly and helpful
Good
Wait time is too too long No drivers found
Good 👍
The drivers and cars are nice and clean. The app is useless with its double charges that result in having to block a banking card just to stop incurring fraudulent costs
"Drivers have become like what cab drivers used to be. Cancelled rides, cancelling when pick up becomes difficult. Horrid experience from when it first launched."
Nice service
It was a topnotch
Reliable taxi app
Drivers have good customer care
"Drivers pulls up and cancels on the opposite side of the road and drives off, and you get charged for it"

"Uber monopoly is bad for us all. Collection pick up times are inaccurate, taking longer to arrive than suggested. Pricing has become too expensive relative to normal taxis, but they have been forced out. The app is poor for customer protections. Eg a recent poor experience was difficult to report. In normal circumstances I wouldn't have paid for the fare, but with Uber you're stuck paying for a substandard journey. Generally, driver quality is terrible (confusing dangerously slow with safe!)"
Excellent
Customer service has been very disappointing lately. I reported a package driver and I saw on the app that the driver made a 30 minute stop elsewhere. I called the driver and he proceeds to lie and tell me he is stuck on the N2 traffick at 1pm!!! I reported this because the price went up almost double the amount and Uber never resolved that issue. I am so close to deleting my Uber account and never using it ever again.
Solid!!!👍👍👍
Nice good

Good but doesn't quickly catch the current location. Also recommends Long routes instead of the Shortcuts present.
Nice
Always delays and they never except rides that are cheaper or in a narrow area then what's the point of having an app if it doesn't help in emergencies??
Comfortable
Bhut bekar he ye galti se bhi Uber me bharosa na kre . Abhi mene auto book Kiya muje uska payment show kar rha tha 146 or driver ne mujse 326 liye bola mere usme to 326 he to Uber me ykin na kre my worst experience

The scamming doesn't stop. I once requeested a ride that I canceled and there was no refund at all. This has happened multiple times and everytime I complain about it through support I am told that my account will be blocked. I had a safety incident more than once that I reported and that was never taken into action. UBER WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ENSURE YUUR SAFETY! The price changes that double at the end of yuur trip is ridiculous. Uber will not give yuur money back when it's their fault!
Very good it's just getting more and more expensive it used to be a lot cheaper
Life would be so much harder without uber.

Different different types of prices for regular customers. I and my friends use Uber regular but my ride prices are more as compared to my friend's ride price.

I love it bcz it's affordable

Uber bikes are basically useless. They cancel the trip whenever they want and asks for more money than the app shows. Today 2 bikes then two cabs cancelled the trip and I reached late just because of you guys. You guys should want your drivers from doing this.. 1st they don't pick-up the phone then after waiting for a while they suddenly cancels the trip... This is irritating. From now onwards I think I should stop using Uber. You guys are worthless.
Nice
"Whenever I order a ride they constantly change the driver , even when they are 3 minutes close they'll stop and say ""finding a new driver"" It's annoying and awful All they charge is you with barely any warning if you want to cancel if you don't want to wait 10-20 minutes after Awful service"
"Trash. If you are going to propose AI as a customer service solution, you might as well just state that customer service is not a feature your company offers. Trash."
Low price
Excellent driver joji
There is no phone call support. I suggest to everyone don't use uber now days. try something another app. They don't response your calls.
"Scam, for me showing one amount and for cab driver showing another amount"
"Ever since I updated the app, it has been picking me up, and a strange location"
Good
Not good but not bad
Trip charge 93 rs total fare 192 rs collected from
My driver was an absolute pleasure to have met and he also knew his way around my city.
The worst app to book a ride...I always book cab from my location to office but they always charge different.
Can you please let users cancel the ride easily? Don't confirm the ride after 15 minutes and expect users to stare at the screen.
Very good and reliable.
Fast and good service

Affordable(with coupons) .The app doesn't show fare breakup. Don't know how much it costs per. Auto rides are always available. Direct UPI Payment option would be beneficial for hassle free payment.
the amount 1238.42 got deducted from my card but the app automatically got closed. I opened the app. I could not see any car booked. Then the app showed "something went wrong" and I had to rebook using UPI. THE Above mentioned amount is not reversed by the uber. Please look into this
Quick rides easy to access
He picked up my autistic son and was super professional and courteous. Thank you!!

Using Uber in London is a joke. Can't get a ride and have to wait for ages so that you can't get away without using priority. Poor service.

Very good behaviour
"What has happened to this once great service? Am in Bristol. Uber constantly cancels, and then the only option is waiting and waiting and waiting for a shared lift home. Awful. Move to another service. This now sucks edit. How has Uber got a 4.5 rating. Look at recent reviews. It's a one star service. What's more annoying is that last year my trip would have cost 20 quid. This new sharing con showed that 3 of us all paid 20 quid. So Uber makes more money and offers us a worse experience. Bolt."
Great
What a well travelled Gent. It was great to solve the world's problems on the journey. Leon's service condiments and vehicle cleanliness and presentation was outstanding. You won't get a better Uber experience.
Great driver really friend had swag and made me more interested in the city life
"Thank you Uber l find it very comfortable, whenever l request your Service. It is Smart, Accurate, Informative, Affordable, Comfy, Comfortable, Cozy. Thank you very much Happy Uber."
Highly Recommended.
It's impossible to find an Uber on London.

Very good taxi and fast
Nearly every trip I go on I never get time to put by brothers seat belt and then mine before we are driver sets of on main roads. Pulse customer service are very rude and put phone down because they don't understand the reasons behind my calls. Rating system worse I've ever come across and is not a fare one for people traveling.
Fast & efficient. Thank you.
Very fast
سيارات سيئة جدا وقديمة وعطلانة تجارب اخر سنة كلها أسوأ من بعضها
Cheapest and safest travel best journey
It should be illegal to increase the fares. Use taxi instead.
"I booked a ride with Uber and it showed 1 minute away. However it took 23 minutes for the driver to reach me. I made it to my train by the skin of my teeth. Uber does not even have a number where one can call and speak to an executive. Very unprofessional, unreliable and unpredictable service."
On average it now takes me 20/30 minutes to get a ride confirmed and multiple attempts as it times out after 10 minutes. Uber claims there busy but the app gives the impression there's lots of drivers about so it's clear there's a problem just not what it actually is. Just book with a local company or go get cash out.
Uninstaller within 2 minutes can't even login anymore app is trash
Very good appsa for all. Now pepole can enjoy to hire a car as a ubar
They got me home a Thursday night of December in Barcelona. No other taxi app accepted my request! They are dope

very disappointed with thursday ..got uber to mater hospital brisbane no problems .. booked uber for pick up at the same place .. first driver turns up i don't no where no able to find or call him ..he cancels trip ..second driver the same .. incompetent pair of drivers ..driver that took me there good ..i rang uber to find out where my cab ride was to be asked if i wanted to book..i explained what had taken place to be told that they had cancelled and i had to pay cancellation fee.. poor servic

"As I buckled my seat belt , my driver greated me good morning Jerry twenty-five minutes to your destination the car was immaculate ,when I arrived she said have a great day."
Hard to tell what side of the street to stand on.
"Great drivers. I couldn't set time. I set 1:00 pm but time confirmed wrong. Tried 3 times. Was able to cancel 1. I called first two at number shown. Phone showed Ontario then BC and neither answered. Finally lady called me, told her my problems. Said she would call Uber so I wasn't charged. Said I would take a cab. Said no, she'd tell them I need 1:00 pm pick up. Nobody came, so guess she didn't. Hope she did call Uber about wrong times. Will try to set time one more trip."
Good experience
This is my frst time really good
"Bailey and Harmom were excellent, quick, friendly drivers. Love Uber better than Lyft clean cars Just prompt sevice friendly and safe drive"
Very bad app because costly and without our request and decision they change the high option and membership Today I also suffer from a bad experience. Many driver doesn't good to find location and because of him we late we also complain to help but no one responding in good ways to help customer.

Prices are a joke. Other apps and even local taxi services have better pricing. Will take my business elsewhere
The motorcycle uber was a great experience
Alot cheaper than lyft usually but much slower to find rides and much higher destination etas even if it's a 10 minute drive you can expect over a 30 minute time to get there
CROOKS. CHARGED FOR SERVICES NOT PROVIDED. CUSTOMER SERVICE UNREACHABLE. FRAUDULENT COMPANY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Polite driver. Very and on time asap. 5 stars employee deserves a pat on the back was quick where he needed to go he knew because I just move here to Abbotsford Thank you
"Drivers not getting any closer, not answering messages or phone calls. Several times that has happened to me. No way to report them or hold them accountable for this behavior. Waiting in the goddamn cold for more than half an hour for a goddamn car! And it's not the first time."
Great app
"uber is stealing, they charge me 2x for rides and say that one of the charges will drop off in 3 days. which makes my account bounce. they are stealing miney and just returning it in 3 days. they are using my money to pay their bills when they allready got payment for the ride. im reporting them to rhe bbb for fraudulent practices."
Network nahi rahta hi paise bhi jyada leta hi costumer care number nahi hi + Fair booking time pe kuch baad me uber charge bhi jorta hai
Daniel was actually pretty good he was Taco Bell nice sweet understanding
"Makes you book a taxi, quoted price 20£ and the final price is 40£. Uber is becoming a legalised scam"
This app is designed for restaurants to scam and get away with it. They never get your order right and Uber doesn't let you speak to a live person. So it's very hard to get help. The prices on the app are higher than if you go to the store yourself. If you can help it don't use this app.
Excellent
The worst app

"Dear Uber Eats Customer Support, I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the service I received regarding an order I placed approximately one month ago. My experience has been highly frustrating and unprofessional, and I feel compelled to bring this matter to your attention. After completing my order and making the payment, I received notifications that the food was being prepared and dispatched for delivery. However, after waiting for 30-40 minutes, I received a call"

I have driven for Uber and I also ride when I get my vehicle serviced. I love driving long distance so Uber doesn't really work for me.
Very useful
"Very polite driver, excellent driving skills."
Trash. Treats both drivers and riders like trash. Steals money from your credit card. Uber lost a chargeback with my credit card because of a false charge. They waited until I got a new card number and charged it. No safety features. No customer support. Drivers get maybe 10% of what they charge customer
The best
Uber is outstanding service provider in all United States. Affordable for All great Choice for Each person
"Very nice , smooth. Ride.. driver was very nice and and a pleasant person to talk to. Blessings to her n her family."

"Expensive. And drivers ask for the travel amount before accepting ride. Drivers also ask for location details incase the amount and distance is not as per their expectations then they decline. Also these drivers never accept and there is endless wait. Worst service had to wait, initially the drivers accept the request and after few minutes cancel the ride. Had to take up normal auto saves time and money."

Uber has become so trash lately 😪 the over waiting for rides and the shared ubers are insane. They basically make 3 ppl ride in a shared uber forcing a passenger to sit in the front seat of these drivers vehicles. Some of the drivers are sketchy so it's kinda a little bit more unsafe

Uber started cheating customers with extra fares after completion of ride and we don't have any proper customer service to contact
It is good 👍 but sometimes it doesn't book after several tries you will finally get the ride.
"Uber used to be good , but now it's giving bad service, can't even find location correctly, take charges for driver cancellation, also their driver are Rude"
Very careful in miserable traffic. Excellent driver.

"Really soo fast and accurate pick-up, drop .🥰🥰"
"Very bad experience ,it doesn't even get you a cab most of the time"
"When all goes smoothly it's fine enough, but the app can leave you high and dry late on the streets by deceptively indicating availability and taking bookings, when, in fact, no driver has been secured, or even worse suggesting one is coming so you to wait, but then drops the booking after some time. Also has really distracting ads / promotional slider right at the point that you are trying to get important booking info which is a total accessibility fail."
Very bad experience 😕
Fastest and smooth
Works very well. No problems and happy with the new security features.

The drive in this uber black was amazing. The driver made me feel calm and relaxed even though I was not feeling good about my Jhb trip.
Love it . It is effective and quick
Super fast
User friendly and instant responder! Simply Great!!.
"Dissatisfied Uber rider, following complicity with drivers running the meter following designated destinations. Very poor, and automated responses from support. Do not provide credit card details for payments!"
Love it
Amazing but the cash was too much
The drivers go to the wrong place on an wait till they can charge you for doing nothing. they will go way out of way for no other reason then to get you to cancel so they can get the fee for nothing it happened to me a lot.
"I had to cancel rides twice in a row because every driver goes to make a stop previous. And I'm still waiting 25!!!!!!! minutes later. You shouldn't allow drivers to take 2 rides at a same time. Besides, many times these drivers are local cab service that either try to cancel your ride and charge you cash or b!tch the whole ride about how Uber takes their jobs... while working with Uber and trying to turn it into their sh!tty service. PLEASE RATE LOW ON THIS, Uber is turning into a mess."
"Very hard to change the trip and they will charge us more if we change, it's very complicated and the drivers forcing us to cancel the order it's really bad comparing with past. for which level this company reach"
Good
"🤔I, DO NOT RECOMMEND IS MY REVIEW THIS IS FINAL DUE TO THE TREATMENT RECIEVED- - 😒buBer IS A JOKE 🤡😆‼️‼️CHARGED ME OVER $35 FOR CANCELLING TRIPS ‼️‼️ OVERCHARGED, ME FOR 2 MINUTE TRIPS‼️ APP. CLOSED MORE THAN 20×'S NON~STOP‼️‼️UNACCEPTABLE‼️"
Can't add credit card as payment option
The fact that Uber does NOT deliver customer support is pathetic. Sure you can query via the help option. But you system is broken since useless employees throw you from mailer to mailer and take ages to respond.
Very good journey

If rain falls for 250 charge he is charging 1000 plus worst app

"Very bad experience, I booked 2 times ride and both times driver charged extra money and when I complaint through app they just message we are unable to refund money ..... Customer care number also did not work......."
Just works.
Can't get proper help
Verry nice service
Fraud company
Drivers discard your fare and make your wait for another.

"Useful, user friendly and well run app."

God Vibe Person.
it's good but sometimes it takes too long to find driver while the app show cars around me available at first.
Today I book a auto my fare is 130rs but auto driver demanded 250rs this so bad experience
"Bad driver, drive for Uber. Can't read a map, drive for Uber. Can't learn a few CBD and major arterial roads, drive for Uber. In all seriousness the bad drivers complain about the money and the good ones seem pretty happy."
Nice work
Good experience
Budget friendly
Having to pay 50 dollars for a 20 minute ride is ridiculous.

My uber app can't work. I can't go online from the last one and half month. Many times contact with uber support but they said we have not any time frame to solve this issue. Poor support service
"I took Ubar Ride just now , It was pleasant ☺️ Driver originally from Bangladesh was very polite 👌"
it's good for all nd available easily
love the app
"What a clownshow of an app and of a company. Laggy, clunky. Driver can just cancel the ride after we waiting for 10 minutes and he won't suffer any consequences for this."
Muy buen servicio.

"Scam scam scam.... I wait for 15 minutes after booking cab, driver was standing in his comfortable position and switches to another driver and driver himself cancelled ride and Uber asked me to pay cancellation fee for that.. why will I pay cancellation fee. This is totally scam from uberm"

1st driver from uber and it was brilliant
Super great Experience

Good App. Garbage company. If you want long wait times for overpriced cold food with customer service which mine as well be non-existent you're about to download the right app.
"Charged me a cancelation fee when it was the driver who canceled on me because I couldn't find his stupid car, his instructions on where his car was were vague. We were in a rush. Deleting this dumb app and never using it again."
Suddenly app has stopped to work
I cannot input my phone number in the app and I am not receiving any Sms neither
Absolutely great drivers and I will recommend it to anyone
Awesome 💯

Couldn't even add a payment method. Tried 3 different cards and google pay too. My friend really needed a ride
This is a very useful application that can use worldwidely. I really like it.

Not as good a rapido but better than ola.
Nice ride every time
Drivers cancel rides left right and centre. When your drivers won't accept rides..what do we do? Make a change in payment to cash and then book...so that someone accpets it... and then you charge me cancellation fees...what stupidity...take the money no prob...but atleasy give proper services. WORST. Worst
Gets you where you need to go
Worst service
Not good. Driver demand extra money

"Reliable, affordable and quality services"
"Uber is AWESOME! I am thankful and grateful for the access and availability! This app does not update my information on new device, nor dies it give an option to input updated information from a new phone. It showed an very old account number that I have not used in years beginning with number 409...no longer in use. I couldn't get ride from a new phone. I don't like syncing my devices anymore. It's difficult now."

"I like Uber the best, it costs less"

Marvelous
Very horrible I booked a ride in advance as I always do the set price I was quoted and charged was not the price after the ride was finished on to of that it has been over 48 hrs with no explanation of why I was being charged extra after the fact of being told it will drop off its just a pre-authorized hold and it's still there make it make since
Very humble 🙏
Fast and accurate rides
Yeah good
Fabulous service
Nice
"This application is very helpful and also fabulous service, anyone use simply and very cheapest price we get on this application."
"I have a suggestion or more like an idea. You guys should give out a point system for customers. Something like, for every dollar that's spent, give 100 points and after so many points. The customer can either get a free meal, free ride, or whatever services the customer is using. The points will go towards that. Something to keep the customers loyal."
Amazing.
Very good
Fast responding nice much better then other stupid aaps I like it
Wrost app we book auto and ride confirm after 1 hours. Very very bad services
Nice offers
App is good but can't find drivers quickly. Waiting time is soo long.
Price is reasonable.. we'll keep it up
"Excellent safe driving, well behaviour, very pleasent with a smile, respected the customers very clean car with ac"
Good service
Bed service very very bad in driver app very good
"Uber is not as good now as before. The drivers are demanding more payment or asking for the drop location.Once i went out for lunch and i was dropping my friend off somewhere while going back home, so i added two stops. The auto driver said ""two stops why did you book less money will come!"" Then i had to drop my friend and rebook again . And today also 227 was total, driver took very long route then i ended up paying 300😫😫😫 lots of problems like this are happening."

Very useless app during emergency no rider accepts the ride when someone is in emergency. Very useless app
Uber spends your money in your bank when it wants to no authorisation needed
Mm M.
Pathetic service..... always searching and if booked then driver will cancel. Kindly do try this app. You will get late because of this app.
I had a good ride and reached at exact time
It shows price than increase after ride
Good
Very nice experience
"When we try to book a ride , please show us the tentative price of this ride . Fix this problem as soon as possible. Otherwise everything is ok."
"It's incredibly odd that they let paying riders be reviewed, you don't see waiters getting to rate customer that give the bad tips or cashier's at grocery stores get to rate customers that yell at them over prices they aren't responsible for so what makes Uber drivers so particularly entitled? Also at what point are they allowed to rate? After they can presume they got a bad review after being rude?? I've never been rude to an Uber driver but I can assume one that was mean gave me a bad review."

"I try logging into my account. It says it'll send a verification code to my phone number. It never does. It then says it'll send one to my email, so I try that. It works, but then tells me I also need to verify my CVV. I do. It tells me there's an error and won't let me move forward. I try using a new account. It won't even send my email a verification code. What is going on? I'd rather use any other delivery service at this point."

"Absolutely horrendous customer service. My order was 2 hours late because my first driver claimed the order and then sat in a neighborhood for an hour. Just to drop the order when they were heading in the direction! My second driver was even further than my first!! I them called Uber support, and after sitting on hold for 10 minutes, they told me they could only offer to cancel the order or give me a 3$ credit... was a uber one user before and after this I was just done. Absolutely horrendous"
Excelent
I have used Uber a few times and I've always had a good experience
Forcing me to take a picture of ID that's never good enough for the stupid app

"Nice clean cars and top notch drivers, compared to some cab drivers"
"Too frustrating to navigate when help is needed!! Recently, however, I must admit my experience with Uber Support has improved considerably; and though at times having my issues properly addressed has been somewhat challenging, for the most part I'm happy to say Uber customer service agents actually do their best to provide satisfaction and adequate information to help me receive positive results as needed.🧏🏻"
"Polite, very good"
I way prefer Uber to taxi. Most wait times in my area are only an average 6 mins from the time you book it. Also so affordable for anyone really. I have enjoyed very much majority of trips.
Awesome
"Great, never had any issues with Uber drivers 10/10"

"Ο ταρίφας έκανε ζιγκ ζαγκ και πήγαινε επίτηδες απο δρόμους με κίνηση, χρεώνοντας τουλάχιστον 2 ευρώ παραπάνω. Όταν επικοινώνησα με την ""υποστήριξη"" μου είπαν ότι δεν μπορούν να επιστρέψουν μέρος του ποσού επειδή συμπίπτει με την ""εκτίμηση"". Στο ιστορικό φαίνεται ξεκάθαρα η εκτεταμένη διαδρομή που έγινε, παρόλ αυτα παίρνουν το μέρος του ταρίφα και όχι του πελάτη που έκλεψε. Η εφαρμογή υπερεκτιμά τις διαδρομές και οι ταρίφες το εκμεταλεύονται βάζοντας στόχο την υψηλότερη εκτίμηση κάνοντας βόλτες"

"It's convenient when it functions, but what's the point of this app existing if i can't consistently get a ride to queue to get me to work"
27 dollara for 3 miles. Used to get 25 miles for 10bucks. Boycott UBER
Worst experience ever
"I haven't used Uber in almost over a year and I find out that my husbands card was being charged for Uber one without mine or his concent. That's theft in its basic form, that's not okay. Id rather take the bus before i decide to use Uber."
i love Uber for rides and for the Uber eats program.
Drivers cancelling after time goes by is my biggest issue we have to pay if we cancel but they get a pass & it's quit the inconvenience. And these ridiculous surging prices 3 to 4 times the normal amout it's BS.
Nice
Most unreliable app always messing up every month and Terrible "support " why I have to get a separate sub to be able to call them .App won't load and blackout it needs to be fixed! It's I'mpposible to get a hold of them if my app doesn't start
The best invention since chocolate
Better and faster experience than other apps ✨
Good
Difficult to learn. Less robust than Verizon messages +.
Very good service
Most rides are not bad and way better than a cab. Nothing ragged. Everything is pretty easy and cool to quickly get from one spot to another quickly.
I love the App but its 100% BS to charge 40 dollars for a 10 minute ride.
TO EXPENSIVE
"So far, drivers are friendly. Still, it's a risky thing to do."
Great experience with Janice
quick service
Excelente service
"Since the seperation of uber and uber eats as apps, the app is never accurate or it never updates the position of drivers when I put in for a ride."
Don't use these apps. As a driver i can confidently say they're using bad routes on purpose just to force the miles and minutes up and they're the ones who keep 70-80%
Good work. Affordable convenient top notch services
"Always fast, affordable and courteous. Love Uber."
Good for first time
"Very friendly, easy to talk to. likes his job and does it well. First time doing Uber. good experience"

"Rides in Bangalore, even airport rides have cng tanks in sedan and Premier bookings. Leaving no place for check in bags. Need to display before hand if the booking/car has available boot space so we can make appropriate choice instead of driver arriving and canceling."
Good nd all app

Uber good
Good driver helped with bags
Great app
Beautiful ride
"Drivers are cancelling all the time, uber doesn't regulate that and it is awful if you have to be somewhere..."
"Drivers'll take double the expected time to arrive, claim they're here when they're nowhere in sight, and cancel the trip. Colossal waste of time."
They do not respond to support tickets. The app has my phone number marked as verified but refuses to let me request a ride due to an invalid phone number. Don't they really they make money if I can use the service and don't if I can't? Wild.
Very good
"The 5 stars are more for my driver Luis!!!!! Very nice man, excellent taste in music, most importantly he got me to work on time which is a miracle. I had a different driver to start with but when I messaged him to double check my ETA, he cancelled, I'd already been waiting like 15 minutes. Anyways, I'm not sure if everyone realizes this but they depend on tips as does servers, bartenders, etc, being a former server/bartender, I will tip even if I'm not thrilled with the service I still tip. TIP"
Very good driver
Good
Very very good
Efficient
"They think delivering gross, cold food within one hour of ordering is acceptable. Do not recommend"
I highly suggest not using Uber for grocery delivery. One delivery driver went full rouge and picked the most random items for replacement for items that "couldn't be located." Trying to bring this to the attention of Uber is futile as they just end the help conversation as resolved when Uber doesn't reply or Uber just doesn't answer.
Excellent
Good in USA but lots of issues when traveling. I'm living in South America for an extended amount of time and the drivers only want to be paid in cash. They get frustrated if you pay in card even if you tip generously and they will give you 1 star reviews for this. UBER please tell drivers the payment method of the rider and do not allow drivers to give fake reviews to riders. My rider rating has absolutely plummeted from 1 star reviews from this trip alone.
Great services and great people

"Today again one bad experience,deiver not coming near asking to call back,i cancel 5time ,still no one came Yesterday night i book uber auto .auto person took double charge of bill amount of 50/- ,before coming to location they are dealing with customer ...it is quite surprising in coimbatore it is now becoming a trend to ask extra which is not a good sign of hospitality and service to customer."
"Worst app . Expensive taxi, drivers not accepting trips. How many times tried to use Uber never get driver that London. Bristol all Uber in Toyota. You wan execute you waiting long. Probably not a lot drivers are really working for Uber. Shame. It's not worth local taxis cheaper and quicker, local taxis you can find any city"
Uber Flash não finaliza a entrega e sou obrigado a pagar taxa de R$50 para reaver meu pacote.

"My first Uber App experience, so easy for this 87 year old!"
"Became so much better, uber has become a must have"
Can't ducking reach customer support when we need it the most. The in-app "help" is a nightmare of documentation.
Uber driver perfect ride app
Excellent service and response
"Uber gives me problems when I'm using it and I usually get duplicate pays which means a pay for a ride twice . My uber eats order didn't arrive and I tried getting help from the uber customer support amd their service was very poor. I wouldn't recommend uber even for my worst enemy, that's how bad my experience with uber was, in fact if I could I would give uber half a star."
Nice person
Very happy great job uber
ok

Scum. Try and cancel premium only to be told you can't do it through the app (why not? Who knows!) and have to contact support. How do you contact support? The app doesn't tell you. I mean why would it? Scum. Scum. Scum. Scum. Scum.
Great!

Amazing taxi
Thank you
"I never had a issue b 4 with Uber, til 2 day, when ,the driver refused to pick me up from the food bank and bring me home, no notice that they would be late $14.95 wasted The worker at the food bank gave me a ride, and was so kind. ""UBER & HOP GET IT 2 GETHER, U ARE LOOSING BUSINESS ""!!!!!!"
Reserved a taxi 24 hours in advance for a busy time. Driver was assigned but cancelled 20 mins after he was due. Another driver could not be found so I then needed to find another way. Needed up being over an hour late and stressed for an important event. Disgraceful. Will never use again
"This is a great app I love it, I just don't like the high rate that would apply on some days."
One of the nicest drivers I've ever had
I like it I only take Uber rides but it's a great app
Experience is good
Excellent drivers
"Sehr gutes Unternehmen mit sehr netten Fahrern, vier Sterne nur, weil ich noch kein Fahrer bin 😊😉"

Horrible I don't have an Uber app and I'm being charged $10 a month for a service I don't use
Auto rikshaw service is not there in this app I am disappointed from this 😔😔😔😔
Extra fund demand at any time ride
"I would avoid uber they charge stuff to your account Uber one, . I used the free trail and canceled the same day. Should never have been charged, 2 weeks later I saw I was chargeed 9.99Uber would not refund me the money I called for a week and a half they kept saying they would refund me but never did I had to Disputed it with my bank they took the charge off I called uber and Confirmed I didnt have a uber one membership so a month I got charged agian 9.99"
"I did a trip with Uber Cab and I even made the payment via PhonePe but still He is asking me to make payment through the app Even after making the payment, it is visible in the app and is not letting me book a new cab"
Good
Don't rely on this app. night time driver accept ride and after 5 to 10 minutes waste they cancelthe ride. And when we cancel the ride they took money from link account. Very worst experience. I almost loss my train. Useless app. Never use again.
Perfect partner!
Scamer of the year..the app showed me 450 charges and later at the end of the ride they charge 1153 it's that fair guys plz say something they are taking over us this incident could occur on u also so uninstall this app...
The app and my account are constantly corrupted by cyberterrorists who add money to the charge and uber doesn't fix it at all. Not worth it.
Excellent
"Often very hard to get someone to accept a journey, despite living next to a main road, requesting a reasonable trip, and having a good rating. Surge pricing is ridiculous. Overall, very disappointing and making want to just have my own car again."
Awesome to use and user friendly. Thank you very much.
Nice
Prompt. Courteous.
Good 👍
Good a delivery pick up and user for Uber services
Uber is one of the worse I have ever used especially now in December. I constantly have to fight tooth and nail to get my money back for drivers who cancel because they didn't check the stops and consider them 'unsafe'.
Good
"Excellent service, curtious driver."
"Nightmare to schedule a ride for someone else, please fix this."
"Crazy to me that when I got picked up at the airport, I was charged me $70 ish to travel at 1am across Dallas, no biggie there. But crazy part is the driver, the EMPLOYEE, only got $29 of that, and the rest went to Uber. That's f'in insane. STOP ACTING LIKE CORPORATE AND ACT FOR THE PEOPLE YOU. While the CEO gets paid more and more by the year, the employees get reduced pay or lack of increases as the years go by."
Drivers ask us to go offline.
Need to do something about drivers requesting more money to pick people up and other scams drivers pull.
Arbaz khan good driving nice parcan thanks 👍👍👍

Ride was safe and friendly
Great service
"I just took a ride yesterday and the fare shown was 465. When we reached the destination driver demanded extra 50%( Rs 235)in the name of return trip. We told him we can't pay that and had an argument. But he was persistent, and as we had to catch the train so we paid and left. Later we contacted Uber for refund , they said they can't do anything about it. DONT BOOK UBER TAXIS IF YOU DONT WANT TO LOOSE MONEY."
"Disappointing that you can't get uber support for a ride you were in, that you did not order"
Was amazing super amazing😍
My last driver was 6star bestttttt
"They don't monitor their drivers in real time. Sometimes, drivers will be assigned and will drive away from you because they don't want to take the route and don't want to be the one to cancel (they want you to be the one to cancel so you pay the cancellation fee). There is no way to report this via the app in real time. Quality control has been declining as they struggle to achieve consistent profitability."
"Reliable and fast, but their riders are purposely extending the time of ride"
Always get a great service! Thank you Uber and you wonderful Uber drivers! 🙏🏻
My Uber driver not only made sure that I got there safely but went above and beyond by helping me find my air BNB and helped me carry my luggage to the door step God bless her

"Uber's services nowadays are extremely poor & pathetic. Paucity of cabs can't find ride easily. Somehow, if it's booked, drivers at their own do cancel the rides at last minute. Further, the customer redressal service is of no use. You can't approach Customer Care on an one-o-one basis (there is no call/direct msg facility available). On App's chat window, you'll keep apprising of your problem, and Uber People will keep responding with Standard and nonsense responses. Time to establish alternate"
"Very wrost service, rider not taking pickup , behaviour not good"
"I will now be using Bolt instead of Uber. On 23 May 2023 I attempted to request a ride. I was not allowed to select the ""pick,up now"" option. I had to accept scheduled ride 45 mins later. Another person at the same pick-up point could request a ride that arrived within 8 mins. Uber and the Uber app has now failed me twice. There are alternatives to Uber like Bolt. U will certainly from now on use Bolt."

Perfect couldn't have had a better driver. EXCELLENT!!!!@

I am using Uber since 2016 and I never disappointed because it makes my ride more comfortable to explore the possibilities which is always closer
Nice app

Nice ride
Very pathetic experience with uber auto...always charging more what was showing in the app...5 to 10 rs is understood but the amount is changed by 80 to 150 rs everytime ...and the support department is more pathetic...they are pretending that they are giving back the same amount...but the amount you can not utilise in the next journey because they will increase the price while paying the bill... pathetic app ever....shame on you guys
Fare charged is very reasonable 👌
Two star deducted because drivers cancelled ride again and again and waiting time so long overall is good
"Disappointed at the fact that drivers can cancel a ride while already having accepted the ride, just because of pricing. They knew the price before they accepted, it tells them what it is, also their wait times are too long."
Help and support are awful
Very well-mannered young man. Thank you
This app is third class app driver demand more amount
"App will not let me log in. Tells me to use a different method or contact customer service, yet does not provide any options for either."
Good
Worst to the worst experience.
Ok
This is amazing
"This app used to be the standard and I used it for years, but I don't know what happened lately. Several minutes just to find someone to accept a ride, 20 to 30 minute wait times for them to get their, and prices higher than they ever were before"
Nice
"Très déçue. Très difficile d'avoir un lift si tu n'est pas en ville, les rare chauffeurs accepte ta demande puis la cancelle dès qu'ils ont une meilleure offre. Tu commence à te préparer et quand tu regarde ton téléphone, tu est de retour au ""Searching for a driver"" même si tu en avais un."
Good service
Unnecessary Charges
Very quick liked it..
Best Riding Experience with Uber 👍👍
Nice application
Nice
Very courteous driver and not very long to wait thank you
Why is uber lying about the miles/km? It is always doubling it... I am 4km away from something but it says 8km? Hence the price goes up...
I love it
Worst app Price changes before and after ride
This app big problem for login. Process
"Great apps, and absolutely no doubt Bangladesh no 1 easy great service provider 🤍💜"
Can't change language
Love uber
Good
Excellent
"Charges went from ₹350 to directly ₹800, would never used this app again."
I got a refund on a bad driver. Thank you uber
Very Good
Only respond on standard template help desk message for fake trip issues. Not even consider any evidence provided.
I got the service where no other app was providing...thanks!
"Faster is seldom faster. It's a gimmick to get you to pay more. Today's fastest pick up was in 3 minutes, according to the app. According to reality, it was 17 minutes before the Uber showed up! Stick to UberX."
Outstanding
Good
Difficult to reach customer service. All is now AI operated which doesn't really resolve any issue you have. App is glitchy.
Good
Top Class Support from the support team
It's very good but some times rides are not accepting long time
Thanks Balwant sir Thanks Uber App Thanks Uber team members Thanks God Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks
l love you uber
Nice
The app does not work. No way to find contacts. Terrible.
Good drive
Superb
"Review for Uber EATS only. Do not use Uber Eats as opposed to other delivery services. Delivery drivers accept your order, then proceed to not deliver your order but to run personal errands or deliver for other services (Uber Eats GPS shows their location). There is no time limit for the deliver drivers so they can choose how long to take to deliver your order. You may wait 20 minutes, or 2 hours, it's up to them. I had two delivery drivers accept my order and then drive miles away. Do not use"
"A normally trip for me is 13 or 15, but from December it is too expensive same trip 35 or 39 dolas. No way"
Flawless service
Stuck on the payment screen post the latest update. Does not let me book a new ride. There's no pending payment in the app. Customer support has not been able to help. Not the expected app experience from a global tech giant. It's been two weeks since I have been unable to use the app. Been a user since 10+ years now...
Great service!!
Good service and driver's good behavior
Very good service and great journey
"Horrible services. All drivers and Bike people just cancel their rides if they dont get paid in cash. Uber is cheating the drivers of their money, customers suffer being on the receiving end of this nonsense"
Good
Very affordable price to ride
Good person and safe driving 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
"Good and safe ride , while stopping, continue asking through notification about safety"
All time driver ask price destination and ask extra amount ask for cancel ride from my side we are late if cancel than required penalty charge from us I never use Uber after today I am using Uber last 3 years but uninstall the app forever no rule is there
Good
Good 😊
I reserved a taxi for the following morning. Ride was accepted. Taxi never turned up and driver never responded to my messages or calls so I had to cancel in order to book a new ride. I got charged the full ride plus cancellation fee and almost missed a meeting. Support has been abysmal.
Worst app
When we are trying to book it will be booked but the driver will call us that we are at the location but once we try to reach them. They will cancel our rides and then it will be taking time to book again.
Nice& hassel free ride.
Best
Good 👍
A bit complicated but I get there in the end. I'm. Old and not technically proficient
uber very helpful
Good
Good drive safely ride
Uber is great thanks to this business I'm able to work everyday thanks
"I started using Uber again after 3years and the experience is still the same. Except this time it seems worse. They debited my account without informing me prior or even after, I found out when I was about to book another trip. The customer care agents are yet to give any particular reason why that debit occured except to tell me ""there is no outstanding balance in your account"" Please tell me why I was debited with a dubious description is all"
App support is pathetic. They take atleast a week to respond to a simple request and that too without any solution
Superb Superb

Good ride and safe lov price rate
Very Good And Satisfying Experience Uber Services Are Amazing And Customer Friendly And Fares Are Reasonable.
Waw.....
👌
😊
This app is not sufficient with the time requested per drivers. When booked a driver app says 5 mins but drivers is really 10 mins and when you request another driver the second driver take as long as the first driver I was better off waiting for the first driver. Uber needs to do better with rule regulations on drivers just like you charge a fee for changing drivers when they take long and request another . Drivers should also be charged a fee when they take long as well. Uber do better!!!!
Disgusted with the services by Uber.
Excellent Service
Good
Good service
"Im pissed, a year, using Uber as only way of getting around Miami, im 5star member. On 12/5 W no money in the bank to call uber (first time) in need stranded & $2 cash. less than 4miles ride straight line. , i got to speak to an actuall human which is unheard of & explained my situation, i said to please take me home that I'll pay for ride my next ride. NOPE! Today i took uber, since UBER LEFT ME SHOWING NO LOYALTY, even tho in profile help menu there is an option membership & loyalty. F.U"
Quick availability and competitive fare with efficient driver.
Good
It was best experience
"Here's a corrected version of your sentence: ""The app said the driver had arrived, but the driver is nowhere to be seen, and his car is not moving, even though I messaged him. Why do I have to pay for penalty that is not my fault? Does this mean I will have to wait for the driver to arrive, even though I'm already late?"""
Nice app for travel
Very Good
It was safe ride.
Good experience
"Worst experience ever I wouldn't recommend this app at all , I had a appointment for passport renewal at 2pm pm so I started booking from 12 00 literally they couldn't even fetch a vehicle for 12kms distance even tho it's booked the driver calls and cancels the ride . Not at all reliable"
Amazing
This app is not reliable for customers. Pick-ups are delayed and the options are not good when you need help.
"Excellent, clean cars , kind drivers ,with Uber we can go"
Very good 👍
Good service
It was nice trip with smart Driver.
Service is good and economic most of the time.
Nice and quick service
worst & scam app. Customer ko kam price dikhakar location ke pohochane ke baad jyada paise demand karte hai driver .. Worst app. Please don't install this scam & useless app. This is the 2nd time jab driver ne jyada paise liye hain.👎👎👎😭.. Uninstalling this useless app. 😡😓
"Convenient and very safe, charges are very moderate"
"If you look at how long a ride will take to get to you, you then exit the app, then go back, you will see the price has increased by a lot! I've also noticed some local taxis are very competitive. Also some pick up spots aren't recognised on the uber map, causing unnecessary stress and complaints."
"I have already paid before ride, but still asked for payment after completion of ride. I am unable get a Customer Care no to confirm that, already paid."
"Not properly visible pair amount... before Booking showing less amount, after delivered showing high amount."
It's been smooth so far... Easy to use and good service.
Excellent Service Fast pickup Safe driving
That's a great service.
My experience with uber auto is very good
drove safely
Good service.
I like it is theappp
"The GPS is unreliable, the drivers use map software and don't know the city, and it costs more than a local taxi. So you're paying more money for a less knowledgeable driver and poorer service. Editing to add that the priority service is a rip off and often not faster or not proportionally faster for the additional cost, and timing's are never accurate. A minute in Uber time is the longest in the universe."
"Unfair Cancellation and Double Charges I had a terrible experience with my recent Uber ride. The driver cancelled my initial ride after failing to reach the exact pickup location. When I requested him to arrive at the correct location, he cancelled the ride. To my surprise, the same driver was assigned to my re-booked ride. I'm now being asked to pay for ride + cancel charges( note: I didn't cancel the ride), which is unfair. I'm extremely disappointed with the service and the lack of support."
"Not only the rates are very high for the consumer, but drivers also get so much deduction and fee charges that they do not accept the rides anymore.. It used to be a great app but now it has gone to shambles"
Great and easy
I felt very peaceful riding with Uber. It's a reliable app.
The behavior of the driver was good
Very safe
Why should i bear the cancellation fees if driver told me to cancel
"O app atualizou hoje e tá horrível de usar. Não encontra a localização atual. Quando abre o chat o campo fica abaixo do teclado e não dá pra ler e ver o botão de enviar. Dá erro, o botão de voltar do android não funciona e só faz sair do app: um verdadeiro caos."

Worst price now but wow the blocking me of rating my recent trips five stars and tipping when I clearly forgot... So wrong . I give up on this company!
Before it never asked for photo id to pickup a rider for me. Now all of a sudden now it's asking for a photo of themselves and a photo of their id and to take a new photo when the driver arrives. Sorry now you're asking too much. I understand it's for safely but now it's become an inconvenience to get my niece picked up.
Very good
I love it

"The customer care executives are hopeless and they are un aware of the solutions to a problem.i had booked a round trip for a destination.but had to change it to single way upon arriving at the destination due to medical reasons.i was ready to pay single way fare plus the waiting charges of the driver so i called customer care.the executive assured me that upon ending the trip i would be charged for only the actual distance travelled and waiting time,but i was charged for the round trip.pathetic"
Good

is perfect
Very good super

The app should have a language change feature. Play Integrity only basic control should be applied. Passkey generation does not work.
Earlier I used to get uber car very easily without any problem but now in last few weeks I don't get any driver even they come to the gate but then ask for the location and then cancel it and misbehave on phone.
"I have been using Uber for a few years now and I WAS very happy with it until the new update. because not only did I use my current phone number without any issues prior to the update with booking a ride through the app using funds from a gc that I had purchased and put $20 cash on the the gf and was able to get a ride to my destination using the money from the gc for payment and now it req a non ""Voip"" phone number to utilize gc option & then won't refund the $ for it, so my $ is stuck on uber"
Very good experience.

I have an emergency today used uber to book a cab but 15 minute is completed waste still in the app not booking the cab on time I have very bad experience with uber never tried again.....!
Worst service by uber as now a days in Ahmedabad the wait time is too long and they drivers even after accepting and coming nearby cancelling ride today I waited more than 20 mins to get ride confirmed same condition with OLA we need something best
Wrost service
Very reasonable and responsive! I have no complaints at all!
👍
Good👍
Veri bed aap not open to my phoan
Terrible app. Cabs are never available. Drivers keep cancelling rides. Rude drivers. Nothing is improving in this app. Uber just charges exorbitant prices. No concern about service.
"As compare to other apps ,This app is much cheaper. N service is also good"
Captains didn't pickup the low price rides in morning due to which I use to get late for the college 5-6 Times
First trip best
Today a uber driver with Car No. MH 48 AY 8024 cheated on me with a extra charges of toll. Such a worst uber driver I have ever seen.
It worst app for auto and who was in hurry it's take more than 30 minutes to book cab and driver always reject the ride
This app won't let you delete your account. User beware
Drivers have been courteous in reasonably experience driving has not been a problem.... I also like the short time it takes for most drivers to pick me up. Thanks Uber. 💯✊🏽
Very good
Love to uber
"works great, simple and quick to catch a ride."

Always works for me so i dont have to worrie about shopping just reach for the app an its all you want.

"Uber is very helpful for passenger,"
It's safe and very helpful
Nice affordable price
"You are pushing your uber pass but the backend system is so bad, I was charged twice for verifying UPI as my payment method and am still unable to buy the pass as the payment method doesn't show up. Paytm wallet is the only option and even it is not working. Do something your company is a joke...even after scaling... Update: still the worst customer experience app and no effort from uber to improve upon it."
The drivers tend to be good but uber charges so much and gives the driver so little
Terrific 👍
Predatory garbage
"Beware of the uber ride share. The driver took my request, never came to get me, ended the ride as if he completed it and uber took my money. The man never came to the pick up location. You can't call to speak with an agent, all they have is text. Uber sent me an email saying the fare was correct and there was nothing they needed to do. This is insane. Been waiting all day and night, as I have contacted uber again, no resolution. Bad business."
Awesome
"The app charged me a 5$ tip to my fare. It's not a lot, but was completely unauthorised and a violation of my rights as a consumer. Scam artists."
Terrible app with no help for customer service. Can't wait to uninstall and forever use Lyft. They made me wait 20 minutes for a six minute ride and I can't cancel!!!??
Its was Good
Very good
I had sent my parcel through uber and the delivery agent took your parcel and ran away. I filed a complaint with uber helpline and now the uber agent is saying that we are not responsible for your item.
"This app is great. Four stars because I wish I didn't get notifications when I have the app open. I'm already in the app, just put the message on my window please. I open the notification and lose my page. Soon it seems I have multiple Uber pages open and am not sure which is the most current."
Good !!!
Thank you I have arrived safe
"Desde hace como dos semanas todos los viajes mandan conductores que están estúpidamente lejos de mi ubicación, no ha habido UNO que esté a menos de 15 minutos. Arreglen su desmadre, bola de inútiles."
Thank you
"Uber has hired habitual criminal offenders, kidnappers etc. as drivers. Money first later security, safety and well beings of passengers."
been perfect so far even gave me 60 credit when I was abused by a cab driver
Whoever came out wit dis uber idea is brilliant it saves money and time on everything .
"This app is a joke. It's charging me for past orders from over 6 months ago. When requested help in the help part, there is no answer for days. Gonna have to call my credit card and dispute the charges. Their help number doesn't even work anymore. They overcharge you on rides after giving you an agreed upon price and not by a couple of bucks but sometimes by 50-60 dollars. Feels more like a scam than anything now a days"
This app is garbage. I only gave it one star because you can't give a rating of 0 or negative stars. This is the least user-friendly app I've ever used. I had to use Lyft because I could not get Uber to accept my pickup location at ATL Int. Airport.
Nabil is a friendly and efficient driver.
Very exceptional
Thank you uber
"Much MUCH CHEAPER then Lyft. Even beats lyfts sales. I'm not throwing shots... I'm just saying. I look at both and it's just better, lower."
A good app for seeing options and rides nearby. But I'm sick of drivers accepting jobs and then cancelling on the way to pick up - presumably because a better job has come in. And uber has no process for dealing with this (unless you are a customer of course - in which case you get penalised if you do the same thing).
Excelente servicio.
Excellent. Far better than Ola.

No good for short trips the drivers won't pick you up

"Didn't receive my full refund for $20.23, and they gave me $5 dollars back they scammed me."
Unable to turn off push notifications for "promotional offers" "membership" "product updates & news" "recommendations" and "feedback"
This driver was outstanding!
Great
"Love this app!! Don't like when the drivers cancel a ride out of nowhere, but I've always had great help with customer service when needed"
"Many times they run much later than promised. In another country, they ask for more money than the trip price or want cash once I get into the car, even after picking me up late. Then others are prompt and professional. You never know what you will g see t. Roll the dice but don't rely on them if you really need to be somewhere on time."
Sending fake promotions & offers and wasting peoples time. Had a very bad experience with unexperienced cx service agents Abdul and Doya. Would say doordash is much better compared to this. I can send the screenshots as well.
Amazing reliable rides

very good!
"It's good for fast food. But if you try to grocery shop with this thing don't do it, its a waist of your time because your just going to have to go do it anyways. I put 7 things of one item on there they'll give you 1 because there trying to shop for 7 people groceries at once to collect the most revenue at the expense of not giving you service if they don't get compensated $25 in tips. Some however are great people but 99% of the integrity of drivers makes this app useless."
The uber driver drove passed me and still took my money . Also then had uber come no where close to the address for pick up show proof and still no refund my money multiple times I'm over it at this point. Not recommended.
Always excellent and reliable.
Good
A learning experience.
Very good service

"The drivers in Bahrain make you wait 20 min and then cancel last minute, happens multiple times, same as if we cancel we need to pay a fee also should do the drivers, v cause now is happening too often, and then you have to wait for another 20 min, total wait 40 mins, that's unacceptable"

Easy for an old woman to do. 🙂
"At fitst you think that the drivers are rude, greedy and unsafe, but then you realise that this is the company culture. In Faro airport they pick up your order, then drive near by and leave as you never come. When you try to catch them they drive towards you, almost on your feet. In Amsterdam, they won't come bc the ride is too cheap, it is just normal. Or, the driver will see you running towards them with a heavy luggage and he will start moving, then he will tell you that he can't take you."

"I paid $73 for a travel that I paid $35 twice before. It's a rip off. The road conditions were not even bad. The snow was melting, there was no ice. Will never use Uber again."
"These days I despise having to use the Uber-App. The integration with Uber-Eats, constant prompts to subscribe and/or up-sale attempts, has made this app absolute hell to use. If you aren't in an area, where cellular networks are top-tier-fast, the app is ridiculously slow. Just requesting a ride, now takes around 10 minutes. Just the request. Not even counting waiting for a driver to respond. Uber! Profit is not everything. You have social responsibilities as well. Do better!"
Good
tiene q improvisar con los conductores mejorar las confirmaciones de las rentas
Value for money!!
I was quoted $66.00 as a special from Port Charlotte to Tampa fl and you charged me $85🥺 maybe I will try Lift.. I didn't know that you all did that kind of business 🙄
"The Uber eats section is annoying. When I'm trying to give directions to my delivery driver, it doesn't give me the option to show them pictures of my location. If the app adds this feature, then it would make both our lives easier"
"Uber is now available in Blackpool, very attractive price for riders"
"Your drivers are irresponsible. They don't care about the customer and because they accept trips, hold them for ten minutes and then be like nah, not gonna do this, I am constantly late to work. I am using Didi. Cannot trust Uber or the drivers."
Very bad service in Egypt Waiting time is too long Drivers doesn't accept trip easily Very very bad service
Sabse ghatiya

Complete rip off and they take to long to pick you up there prices are outrageous they charge me 23 dollars to the corner and back they give no deals ready to delete my account
Most usable app for everyone 👍
Nice
Thank you so much Mr Aslam for giving me A wonderful Ride I will Never forget this moment
Friendly and Perfect Driver
Best experience
Mr. Muhammad went above and beyond to find me. It was raining so hard I had to manage in a not so visible area to avoid the rain. He was courteous and very professional.
Safe and smooth driving and nyc behaviour of driver.
I don't like this new modus operandi. It takes forever to get a ride when an order is made and it appears it's done on purpose to lure you into ordering a hight priority ride. Pointless I must say...
"Uber is a very bad company, firstly they do not refund the money and secondly the vehicle does not leave on time, brother it would be better to walk, as requested by their company, do not go by vehicle"
Sending me proof codes are unnecessary.
"Drivers cancel orders one after another, better use Bolt.. it îs more expensive but more professional"
"Don't use this app if you are not a frequent traveler. Even though you have paid money for your ride, they don't update their system. And if you try to book ride after 30-45 days, they ask again for the money which you have already paid for your previous ride. And also Uber is hopeless as well as helpless to their customers if they try to raise query after 30 days regarding money complaint. They don't accept complaints after 30 days. Seems big scam. Use other apps If possible."
Always there when I need a ride
I love it
Bad app service not recevice short ride picked
Good super
good app
Good 😊
Can always rely on them and the fare and convenience in the car to your destination. Thank you for your excellent service.
Nice and reasonable a big 👍
"Waited 1 hour for a ride that never showed up,walked 5 miles then hitchhiked to a restaurant where your driver picked me up. I am pissed ! No customer service whatsoever ! And I talked to cust serv who said""no ride in that area"" duhhh How will you compensate me ? Or do I just delete your app ?"
inorrect GPS and Outrageous fees.... Both issues ignored.
I booked a ride it's showed 10.19 dollars but after ride is completed it cost me 5 more dollars when I went to complaint at customer service it is showing me there is no increase in fare it is 15.19 dollars from the start so the the app didn't even me option to complaint this the worst experience
Sometimes I've had really rude drivers but it'd been about 2 years since I personally had an uber for myself and today this guy was amazing!!
Worst experience 😔
Nice trip
"Wait times and estimates are always incredibly off and unreliable even if you order an hour ahead. Uber one wont save you more than 7$ a month on rides, that barely pays for a ride down the street and you're spending about 10$ for that monthly subscription. Its a scam. Drivers are majority very rude, but that could just be my area. There have been times when I've needed to dispute a charge and they wont let me. Absolutely terrible hate it :)."
good
Please don't download this app very bad service ride take ride then rider extra money if you don't agree with rider then rider cancel the ride and rider ask extra mony tjid this option isn't available this app so please 🙏🙏 don't do not download the app

Driver cancel ride halfway before coming at pickup again and again
This app fastly provides auto or bike etc. in comparison to other apps like rapido and ola and with less amount then that apps (experience of three years of using this app)
Good service
Nice
"I scheduled a ride for the morning, was given a price. Confirmed. I was outside before the driver, no stops. I just checked my phone and I was charged DOUBLE! Double!!! Heavy traffic isn't on me and is not an excuse to charging people double the quoted price without any notification. It's a Tuesday morning in L.A., of course there's going to be traffic. Useless Ai ""support"" chat."
Quick ride
"Works technically, but id always double the time estimates it gives, which seem to ignore the laws of physics. Ive never had a ride make it to me in less than double the time estimate."
Nice person & good service
Worst app when I book ride fare was 240 but after reaching destination it's showing 400. Not going to use UBER again
"I literally have a brand new Samsung, and everything else works fine but this app won't even start on my phone ????? so now uber has become completely useless to me...."
Good
Thank you
Good
Awesome app. I love the rating system so that I can make better decisions about who is my driver! Very convenient!
I always have a great experience when I use uber.
Not a useful app always expensive.
Pick your poison uber or lyft. I choose Lyft. Uber locked my uber & eats account from October 13 until now for no valid reason except to force me to sign up for uber one. I couldn't not request any rides or use uber eats. They even interfered with me receiving uber eat receipts when I ordered thru instacart. Then they tried to force a uber one transaction when i didn't authorize no transaction or even sign up for that service. I have spoke to literally 8 different CS agents who BS me why.
All good
Very disappointed for this no customer suuport rides are too expensive i preferred ola and Rapido
for me uber proved better than rapido
Very nice service
Amazing driver come and collected car was clean 👌 🙌 👏 👍

One of the worst service
I can't even open the app.
This app does not work for me anymore it's annoying me all I want is to go
They won't let you cancel a ride
cars are old.dirty.even the premeiers one. drivers are oh?
Really good
On time capable and pleasant drivers from ERW to Scarsdale and back to JFK. Good value. Will likely always book with Uber. Good app.
Great ride
"I hate my Uber Experience. Booked a Auto Today which was in the worst condition ever, Front Glass shield broken, auto body rusted, also he was driving Auto with different registration number than mentioned in the Uber App. He was Rash driving and spoke to me in an unethical way. He also demanded 50% extra fee. I am disheartened with Uber now and will never use Uber again. If Uber Support sees this, I can share the Auto Registration number if you really want to help customers like me."
"App does not work very well at all in rural areas. I've been left stranded either due to no available drivers or an error telling me something went wrong when I attempt to reserve a ride. Lack of availability I can understand, but ststem and server issues are inexcusable."
Its reliable 👍
"This app is now a scam and the heads of uber have become cocky with how the app prices journeys. Used to be good, now utter rubbish. There are inflated prices constantly. They inflate the prices if u use a gift card, u get little to no discount as an uberone member and if u do, its a discount on an inflated price so u still pay more. wait times are slower now unless u pay an inflated price. used for couple years but it's obvious now. Don't pay for uberone, u get nothing back and pay more for it"
Not what it used to be. Had 3 drivers refuse service after sitting in car asking where I was going. Was stuck at a bar for almost an hour trying to find a new way home. It was a 30 min drive nothing crazy. Drivers accepting pickups without knowing destination wastes everyone's time. "Just get an Uber" isn't a thing anymore.
Very bed and slow service.
"Fraud App, money was paid in cash to driver, but this app is again asking to pay and while booking new trip it adds the previous amount again. VERY FRAUD"
Cab finding is fast but sometimes the drivers cancel and then it's a lot of problem
Great!
Enjoyable
"Reliable, Quick and cost efficient. Nice drivers."
Good
♥️♥️♥️
Nice too meet uhhh✨💗
Always have a nice experience with Uber!
Verry nice good job 👍
Very complicated app.. I had to search so many instructions to do anything. The app doesnt allows to choose other rider and book a cab at later date.
Very nice taxi service at affordable prices
Quick response friendly behavior good and safe ride
"Blocked and deactivated my 6 years 5 start account without giving any explanation and then gave an automated response when replying, neither me or anyone in my family will ever use this trash app again."
I ordered an Uber. Got the ride. Once I arrived another driver phoned me and asked where I was. I told him I had just arrived at my destination with the Uber per my app. On my next ride there was a R130 outstanding balance. I did not order 2 rides and got cheated by Uber
Nice
Good app
Great 👍 service
Nice app
Rider was good and he dropped me before the
Wrost application..don't use it.. When I was booked auto there's shown affordable charges after dropped at door step auto driver ask for extra payment rather than shown in application... It is not worth it along with local travel
It is great👍
They kept hitting my card
Guys better you use ola Or rapido totally froud app at the beginning it show's you less amount and then argue for extra amount after trip I have a proof never use this froud apps
Ride booking time Rs.399 show kar raha tha but ride ending pe Rs.678 show kar raha tha jo mere online wallet se deduct ho gya. So I am not satisfied this app.
It was good
Ok
Extremely horrible service especially after 6 pm as drivers refuse to accept trips
this app was made just to annoy people as much as they can. want taxi? pay us but we won't send you any link to pay. that's my experience so far
Good 👍
"Remove cancel ride option from Drivers App or charge heavy penalty because they morons cancel rides when someone in medical emergency or any critical situations, If you did not remove cancel option from Drivers app, I swear I will convince and delete your App from my all family friends relatives and colleagues and will everything until you remove that option. Start now."
Nice
"Booking amount se hamesa jyada rupee₹ lgta h, almost 30-50% jyada."
Good Service
Never take yet to a major event. $40 to get there. To return ride after ride cancels about the driver's ask for 3-4 times the quoted fare. Will not use again.
Very good but offer is great it should be for more time I love this offer
"Drivers are forcing to pay by cash or leave inbetween the trip & with multiple complaint to Uber seems there is no solution, this happened twice in Bangalore location. Already complaint raised so don't show your fake words & sympathy like we will check."
Very good
Comfortable I like it
Very good service 😃
"I hope you make arrangements for a different ride when they're busy or the weather's bad because if you don't you'll be paying out the *ss...anytime they get busy they jack the price up, what usually costs me $9 will cost me $40...they just do this to take advantage of people...I would've given no stars if I could because this happens to me almost everyday"
Very fast
"This review is related to uber transport cars and autos. Rates are ok, except for the cancellation charges which are totally irritating....Not all cancellations are customers fault....99 percent the cancellation issue is not related to customer.....if this issue is addressed uber would be the most preferred."
"I don't recommend, drivers smell so bad and does not speak properenglish , cars are not up to standars , the app need a lot of development always messed up with location, if you are late dont book from this app"
Super and amezing
Great
very good loving the service

"Tried it once, middle of the day on a Tuesday. Utter scam. Jacked the trip price up three times, then charged me four quid to cancel. Never again. Uninstalled, deleted my account. Next time will use local taxis."
Excellent💯👍👏
Excellent service
"Kinda disappointed in the way uber does business. Gives an option for a quicker ride for some amount more but can't even get a quicker ride. Seriously? If you're rides are gonna be longer, no point in giving the option. You are better off using Lyft or Ztrip. Uber is only good for their food delivery, and even that is iffy."
Very comfortable ride
ممتاز
Super aplication
Very easy to double tip and no easy way to undo it.
"When I chose the Uber and time to pick up me, they didn't get to exactly the address, and they canceled. That's the worst thing they can do. Today the Uber was canceled again and assigned another one. Isn't the first time Uber did that. It's really stupid to charge me more than 18 dollars, and the Uber came late. The Uber didn't come the time that I chose when I reserve the Uber."
Very. Bad Uber service long time tk koi driver ni cabb uthata agr koi utha le to cancel kr dete hai koi rule ni hai very poor service ho gyi hai Uber app ki too much bad pls improve ur app Punjab ludhiana too much bad service

Good Service and reasonable price
overpriced. delivery service is awful. lack of customer service contact options.

Very BAD service
Good morning uber
Nice
My experience so far is amazing
"Customer service is the worse... they just don't care at all about the wrong doing of the drivers. Plus it's more expensive than other apps. And at least in my area, drivers have so many wrong doings like driving away without you just to collect the cancelation fee since the app makes it so complicated to complain about the drivers that a lot of people just let it go. Many of them are maniacs on the road and they get offended if you ask them to drive safely or they straight up ignore you."
Very Good..👍
Amazing
Absolutely brilliant
Smooth ride
Good behaviour
I Love ❤️
Good 👍
verry good

Very Good Trip
Constantly changing prices. Outrageous wait times. Says ride is 4 mins away actually 20 mins. Then when you wait the driver still has the option to leave you waiting. NO RIDE!!!

Beautiful app hai
"Worst app, while booking it showed 161 after dropping price changed to 321 & there is no option to call customer care, AI answers r not relevant.I will never use uber in my life again OLA is far better what they show they charge only that."
"Very awkward.No scope to lodge complain easily,if any ."
"Sometimes, it takes a lot of time to get a cab or auto booked"
Good experience
Well done

Palhaçada! Esses motoristas aceitam corrida depois cancelam. Temos compromissos! Esse pessoal quer rodar só no centro da cidade?! Absurdo! Olha o processo...
I always use Uber and have found them to be very efficient.
It's Safe and Awsome
"They are doing very well nowadays,in terms of punctuality and quality."
"Very poor service, do not try. They charge unexpected beyond your think on the behalf of surge charge. Their customer care service is even wrost service in India. I want to give Zero star but there are no option."

Great services provided
I use Uber every chance I get and I own 2 cars. So many times I just don't feel like driving I call Uber. I will be calling in a few days.
"Waste of time and money, I am still waiting for around 40 minutes and no driver is accepting the ride. There are cabs showing on uber maps but no one is accepting the ride. There is no way to contact uber support. I am frequent traveler with uber with more than 400 ride in 2 months and still facing these problems. Uber doesn't respect time of their customers. I have faced this issue many times. Shame."
Always reliable

"I used uber almost on a daily basis, but today will be my last ride. Uninstalling the app hope others do too. What a dirty trick to start charging more in order for a car to arrive without a 10+ min delay. Instead of rewarding customers you try to take advantage of them."
They are bad. I subscribe and paying 6 GBP monthly. Now during raining day they want me to pay extra otherwise they assigned me far away driver who needs more than 10 minutes to arrive. It still the same policy even after one year
Yeah
Quick to arrive knowledgeable about destination pleasant and comfortable trip friendly driver
Laxed out. Driver was low key
ok
"Very terrible experience, Multiple times I have to pay amount 2 times to settle the payment 1. Firstly complete the payment to driver it is not updated in the uber account again we need to finalize payment and it happens with me more than 5 times... Wrost application ever seen. Even customer support is not working for Uber."
"Cars always arrive, and drivers always courteous. Great value."
Very very Pungchual good and faithful and good response n effective n marevlless work and also very safe next time when I will take only n only Uner cab may God bless your work with dedication.

Really Great service

"Never had a issue until I signed up for Uber Express Drive & used a portion of the provided voucher to pick up a reserved rental vehicle (which was declined at the rental lot because they didn't have any cars for Uber drivers).. long story short the remainder of the voucher is still in my account so whenever I book rides the app states the ride will cost $0.00, but after my trip is completed I'm charged a different (higher) amount! Uber customer service doesn't even respond to my help requests."

Very bad app totaly waste of time .
I can't even pay upi
"I love Uber their services are very good and safe. At the same time, i use my bank card .It's the transport you can rely on, so I give 5 star 🌟 is incomparable .I feel safe with is because is very safe indeed"

Supper Mind blowing Fantastic Unbelievable
"Uber's payment system is giving an error again, and there is no contact number or chat for this problem. Be careful! I have 800 reais in credits stuck on the platform, which should be for grocery shopping. And it doesn't even matter if I'm a subscriber to Uber One, I have no assistance even though I am a subscriber. It's completely helpless. There is no way to get help, and Uber is not verified on any consumer protection website in Brazil. All I have to do is take legal action."
Showing some amount when booking and after dropping off showing in increasing amount

"I dont know why the price of uber was change,, when i was booking the uber, its only 71 sr. And when i arive the location the price was change,, its already 82? Please thats not good.. Its verry disappointed..!!!!!"
Price is budget friendly
बहुत बहुत अच्छा लगा किसी भी तरह की कोई दिक्कत नहीं हुई। अच्छे कार्य औ व्यवहार के लिए धन्यवाद
4 days ago I requested a cash trip for my mom. The driver was given cash but I still had the amount owing on my account. This amount which was already paid affected my next trip which resulted in me having to settle it before I could request a trip. I paid for a single trip twice. After multiple escalations to Uber this issue remains unresolved with agents advising that it has been resolved. This is unacceptable as I have never had any driver steal my money🤬😡😤 I don't recommend Uber at all😡
gentleman
Friendly user
"Poor, very poor, I was robbed my money and they dont even try to help you. I ordered a Uber trip and the driver never picked me up and my money was deducted from my account and they didn't make any effort to send my money back, very disappointed in this app!"
No matter WHAT time of day or night I have to try MULTIPLE (I'm talking 4 plus) times to get a driver. And I'm never even asking to go far. Lately it doesn't even find a driver.
Reasonable price
Some time it's good some time to very bad
Thanks great driver great ride
Good price and service
Nice
Good service and value for money
Best.
"The drivers have recently started demanding whatever they want to and the app does nothing. Sometimes you wait for a ride for 18 mins, even though the guy is in the next street and they cancel whenever they want to. But the customers are repeatedly fined for the delay caused by the driver and the app does nothing about it."
Exceklent
only 1 out of 10 drivers accept your request. Install only of you have got a lot of time to waste on bookings.
I live in Merida Yucatan. Uber drivers touched me and now Uber blocked me
Good

"very bad service,was too late to reach to my coaching centre and then they increase the price rating it 1 star for a reason!!!!"
Collecting more than bill amount. Drivers not coming after accepting request. Canceling due to unavailability of driver or driver not responding. But cancellation charges are being collected. Drivers are coming very late after accepting the drive request. Better to avoid uber usage. This is really bad experience with uber.
Bad service in Bangladesh
Good
Worst application. Useless promotional banners in the app and rider never books on time. No matter how they increase the price. Totally hated this application 👎👎👎👎👎
Not download
I uninstalled this app. The new update is not user friendly. Will no longer support it and no one else should.
"Worst service, waiting time is too too long even nearby location plz improve your services."
"Terrible customer service when asking for more help and assistance. Unfortunately, I have no way of talking to a human when experiencing a problem with my trip and driver."
"It's became really worst. Showing cheper prize only but it won't get Book, even after waiting half an hour. It's not first time. I have faced this issue many time. When I plan to go little early. It's just waste of time to using it."
Amazing ride sharing app.
"Uber driver, dropped my nephew off miles from the where is supposed to take him. Made him get out of the car. I have been trying to for 3 days to get a person on the phone. The customer service people are not taking this seriously."
"UBER Service in Belgaum location is available only for name sake..The moment you try to book uber auto, no service is available.. Please provide all services first and then inform that UBER service available at Belgaum."
Good
I am being charged money I do not owe every time. You can request a ride and it shows one amount which you agree to and pay. Then when the trip is ended there's another 10-15% charge. Either the drivers fault or they UBER just robs people. Uber is a scam. They do no respect consumer rights act.
Very nice app and good service ane low payment and really i like uber team
Good 👍🏻

"Uber is always coming thru way more tough compared to any/all it's competitors. When comparing to Lyft, Uber 9 times outta 10 has the better price option and always gives multiple options to try n help the rider save. I've noticed for some reason and idk y, but 99% of my drivers are more polite and keep their vehicle much cleaner along with snacks and other accommodations. I pay for a rideshare at least 2-3 times per week minimum and have no problem switching my #1 choice! $@*!#001UBER100#!*!@$"
"Just simply superb, drivers never negotiate for extra payments."
One of the best Affordable n Easily available I love uber

Very worst experience while booking and thier payment process is very bad
Price changed from 7 dollars to $40 for unknown reason and a driver didn't even shop up. Nearly missed an exam
I think uber is a scam and just charges whatever they want once they know your daily routes.For example how can a 28 dollar ride turns into 62 dollars when it's the same route taken and there was plenty of uber drivers in the area at the time I booked it.SCAM I think DIDI is going to be my new preference.
Best rate ever
"Booked tril for $140, driver took a slightly different route (same duration) and was charged $180!"
"Coloca um endereço e vai outro no destino. Se arruma o endereço pra 700m para corrigir, cobram um adicional de mais de 20% e não tem como reclamar com ninguém. A sessão de ajuda fala que tava certo e fica por isso mesmo,impossível falar com algum atendente humano."
Thank for ride
The best of the best
"Driver Jeffrey was grateful, but I left my phone in his car today around 10:00 am . How can I get it back?"
Soo good
We detected a problem??!
"Very patient and courteous driver, a pleasant trip home."
Very bad application
He was great thank you
Very efficient.
"Unnotified of membership renewal... Terrible customer service as I am still awaiting for a reply for a possible refund. It's disappointing that I only have 2 days to refund, them taking their sweet time to reply... Definitely don't recommend this app but instead invest your membership in LIFT."
"Prompt, Reliable cool service"
"Uber really came through for me.I really needed transportation at that time. I missed my shuttle bus and Uber was right there within minutes to provide me an alternate way to get to my destination.I could never forget about this experience.Thank you again, Uber for getting me going in the right direction.. You didn't let me down.I will speak good about you moving forward.👍🏾"
"Driving for uber can have its perks at times but they way they treat their uber eats drivers is horrible. Your cancelation numbers for instance are extremely important and the lower they are, the better for your account. Uber gave one of my orders to someone else after I was waiting 2 hours for it and then another hour had to be canceled because walmart stopped deliveries and all 6 orders total had to be canceled when it was ubers fault but my rating is what got affected. They are horrible"
Exceptional
"An excellent driver, very polite and courteous person. We recommend him very much ."
Inki services bhaut slow hai aagar hu. Koi ride book krte hai to 4 min ke time dikha kr vo 30 min le lega but Cab book nahi hogi or aagar book hua to bhaut bar driver cancel kr dete hai baat krne ke baad bhi or hum cancel krte hai to humko charges laga dete hai recent ne maine cancel kiya tha to 47 rupees ka charges laga diya or same ek driver ne book kiya to uske liye koi compensation nahi diya gaya bhaut hi bekar service hai inki.
Picks up in the middle of nowhere sometimes. Searched residential for who has the app on
I needed to add a trip and keep my driver. You changed the app and now I don't know how to do that. You screwed me AND your driver. He took another trip wait for me to come out and now I'm at Walmart with my lunch box that should have been left in the car.
"Horrendous customer service. Random automated messages are sent without customer requests being read. No action is taken from the agents, unfortunately. Cases are closed without me having the possibility to respond and then the whole cycle is repeated again. It's been over half a year and I've not been able to get any sensible help. One star for the effort or lack of given."
"The driver are great people but the app itself has some problems one being that it doesn't get my location right, unfortunately for myself I need this app to get around sometimes, so uninstalling it and reinstall it and see if that fixes the problem"
Always nice and clean. And very polite. And the drivers are amazing
"If you have any issues as a rider, there is no option to contact the support. There are many glitches in the app but it seems like they think it's perfect and no need support."
If i book a ride the day before. i shouldn't be late to my destination. The driver has been 15 to 20 mins late three times on a ride I book the day before. I almost got fired!!!
"Excellent service, quick and safe!"
Wonderful and exceptionally relaxing
Price is too inconsistent
he came quickly and he was fine .. eg nice not rude everything was ohk with the driver
the app and getting help is horrible..on Saturday a driver called and told me to cancel because he wasn't going to come which was not my fault but they still charged me and also a cancellation fee. didn't agree so they refunded me the money but then charged me for it again the following day and trying to get a hold of someone to talk to was impossible and giving me chest pains so I just had to go through my bank for my money
very nice
Good service 👍🏻
I am now so frustrated with Uber and DoorDash both I can never ever get my orders right with these guys either one of these companies it is the same can't order a combo with a drink cause I never get the drink. The $5 ranch I ordered with the $50 I spent from Buffalo Wild WingsJust all over the bottom of the bag. I almost lost all my food through the bag cause it was just so soaked all around the food I want to dip my ranch not soaking my food in it. From my experience every attempt is awful.
Great aevice
I hope come back to the Philippines
They rip off both customers and drivers avoid use them
This app customer service is bad my app not receiving verification code in number and gmail
Anita was wonderful and nice
Gary was great!!
"Overall it's been fantastic...only complaint is the driver could not find us, and I had to redo...I did, got a new driver that could find us, but I got charged for his lack of knowledge. I gave him the largest land mark in the country. Not happy to pay for his ignorance."
Constantly confirms a trip and then changes the driver and pick up time.
Very reliable Very prompt friendly service I like using uber
It was very nice trip
"Since 2021 it is estimate that Uber has slashed 85% of customer service employyes (NYT) and replaced those functions with AI chatbots designed to delay, delay, and deny any customer servixe requests (WSJ). Please take this in mind before you end up in a situation where your financial or even safety issue may not responded to by a human being."
"Downloaded the app, had two quick rides today for the first time. Big bang boom, done. Even leaving tip takes about 10 seconds. The app is slick and I can watch the car the entire way before I'm picked up until I'm dropped off, in real time. Sweet use of technology"
Good service
Very helpful
Drivers are mostly nice but costs to ride are getting as costly as cabs.
Helped me at midnight to book a cab for an emergency patient.
Perfect
"I've used uber plenty of times. The one thing I hate is that sometimes the driver will be a few minutes away and they decide to cancel on you. HOWEVER, recently I booked a ride and the driver had already dropped me off my location, and the ride was STILL GOING. After an hour, I finally hit the cancel button to stop it. THEN, the next day uber charges me a cancelation fee over $100. I was already dropped off and the driver, never ended the ride, so how would you charge ME a fee?"
"Hi, it not easy for old people, that never used uber. it was in the past much easier with a city taxi. But I thought I must try uber. Till tomorrow thanks"
Good
Best service
Great service
nice
"Not great. You can have a driver 2 minutes away who then cancels for a better option. Then, when you try to locate another driver, it is unsuccessful. So i try to rebook, and the price goes up $20. Broken system if you ask me."
Always seems to use. And paying at the time that you schedule your ride is in added plus in my book. I have not met an unpleasant Uber driver.
The app is only one piece of the problem: I've just seen this company prioritize their wallets over our safety a few too many times. I can't responsibly allow myself or my loved ones to risk our lives to protect your greed any longer. Shame on you.
Love it
Convenient of course
So far it's been very easy going in a pleasure to work with
Much needed. There when you need them.

Derrick was personable. I enjoyed riding with him. His person and car were neat and clean. He helped with my luggage and was considerate about bringing me close to my door. Derrick is professional and displayed an outstanding performance.
Worst service if devier not reached place you people chargeing cancel ride fee
"I have a few issues regarding payments etc. Issue 1: I booked a ride for my wife, the driver let her wait for 15 mins saying he is on his way then cancels but when I canceled a ride after 3mins I have to pay a cancelation fee, the driver was 5 mins away when I booked. Issue 2: I booked a ride on Uber Lite app, it gave me an amount of R56 + R10 cancelation fee, when my wife had to pay the driver opened the Uber app and it gave an amount of R100, how can these 2 apps give different amounts?"

😊
very nice experience of ride through Uber.
"No descargar!!!! Estafan a sus chóferes, es una mentira a nivel global!!"
The experience has downgraded recently
Very good service
"Reliable, safe, and great value for money"
Worst experience with the company. Uber Premier is a scam. Most vehicles come with CNG fitted tanks and there's hardly any space in those vehicles to even keep luggage.
Mostly reliable. Hasn't failed me yet.
Excellent
Unbelievable service 😀
Wait times are ridiculous now. You try to book a taxi and it takes 10 minutes to find a car!!!! Pathetic.
Good rider fraind
Superb experience
Nice
Continuously using predatory pricing. I had pricing on the depatures at $20 to get home and once the app realized I was at the airport arrivals the price jumped to $45. It's disgusting to inflate prices for no reason than knowing people don't have other options.
Best service safty + low cost
Prompt and convenient ♥
"Keep getting harassed by texts that i can't unsubscibe from and that have a number I'm meant to text to unsubscibe which is an invalid number. I wanted an app for utility, not to be harassed by the parent company 🤬"

"really poor service at such a busy time drivers are ignoring requests for rides in order to get the more expensive option and THEN try and acceptthe ride to attend. while I appreciate times can be busy, to have NO ONE pick up is ridiculous. I have never waited an hr for an uber, even in busy times, since I started using them and this is poor customer service."
Nice drivers and app
Good
The driver is good and very professional
"No watch app. I want the ability to order a ride from my watch when I'm out somewhere without my large phone. Pick-up times are very inaccurate - it says 3m, then when I choose an option within 20s it says 14m. App resets my zoom and focused area periodically after I manually change these while waiting for a ride. Very unreliable."
"I requested an Uber yesterday morning in N. Deland and Francine arrived within 10-15 minutes. Her car was spotless clean, she was very friendly and professional, and she was a very safe driver. She took the shortest route and helped transport my very heavy bags to my next mode of transportation. Hats off to Uber and a big THANK YOU to Francine! 😊"
Very good

Nice trip

Loge it affordable price
Great
Customer service not help me to return my laptop lost
Not able to book ride it will take 10-15 minute's minimum every time to book a ride
I appreciate the discounts I get now and then..
Must use app.
Good
"No customer support, too much waiting time.. Withdrawing credit from Visa before the trip starts is a disastrous update!.. You stole money from my credit and the trip was canceled with no money return!!!"
Hi sir
Wonderful
Very bad app initially showing 461rs and after the trip they asked for 1057rs its worst and disgusting everytime the fare issue arises very bad app use rapido instead 😡👎👎
Uber bike and cab driver are not accepting the voucher payment and trying to pay through Uber wallet they not accepting they are asking only cash or UPI payments. They are saying like uber deducting their amount So there is no use of voucher and uber wallets
One of the worst app to use . Driver and the customer service both are useless
Horrible experience in my second last review
Best service
Food is never fresh
It was my 2nd ride in uk. Safe and gud drive of driver...
Okey
Would give a lower rating if I could. Company takes advantage of drivers while continually providing terrible support/ service for what's listed as premium service. Go to Lyft Uber blows.
Great

The new update us pathetic
Lo peor que puede haber cuando pides comida te roban........no llaman si no encuentran la ubicación. Mucho más caro que in driver ........

"Convinent and affordable local drivers. Thank you Sahim for the welcoming experience in Auckland, New Zealand (after midnight) and sharing top places to visit."
Very bad
Ok but it showing different prices to customer and driver
Booking after he only cancel Taking long time of booking time and asking extra money also booking time tip otherwise not booking and not giving respect for ladies It is too much money not answering uber helpline also best of time downloading and using very worst app in auto service 😔
Nice
Excellent
Fares are miserably unaffordable without coupons of 10% or more.
"I quit using Uber, because there's no customer service.. if you have a problem or complaint, you're screwed.. I switched to LYFT.."
Comfortables good driver thank you
Very good.
"Elisha was wonderful! Punctual, helpful, knowledgeable about airport! Thank you Uber & the great driver, Elisha!"
I am very very satisfied with my Uber service I'm new to Uber. I was faithful to lyfte for like 2 years but there prices were starting to get ridiculous. And I've always waited more then 20 to 30 minutes for my rides. Now with Uber I've never waited more then 10 minutes and really like that getting off of work I didn't enjoy waiting 30 to 45 minutes to go home. Now I'm picked up in 9 minutes or less.
Good
"Uber driver cancelled the trip, demanded triple the price and then took me to an ATM and demanded I take out even more money. When I reported this to Uber they offered me a 70 cent refund for the inconvenience. Be careful using this app in some places. The drivers may try to rob you and Uber will do nothing about it."
"Ok Uber is typically pretty great but whoever works for customer support either has selective hearing or is really incompetent. And I don't mean to be rude but it's extremely annoying that as Specific as I am, ya'all still don't listen. You guys punish the wrong driver for mistake of another driver. I didn't want a refund of the trip my driver was great and u refund my driver's tip. Makes me mad because u also block her from driving me. Also, this AI thing is bologna! Uber get it together 🙄😟"
"Uber is awsome, my driver was great this app sucks and it is very confusing and over constructed; keep it simple guys, we just want a ride and not to complex. ( meaning if I wanted to drive myself, I would. )"
It takes a lot of time for the confirmation of ride during festival days and makes us waiting more than an hour also sometimes it doesn't shows the option to cancel the ride
Really easy to use even for me
Good
অনেক ভালো
Uber app is not only good but also best For Us. Uber app is very good application.
This app isn't very good I carnt get into my app
Super ride experience
"While I love the app, there is no way to get hold of any customer service. It's ridiculous to believe a company would completely depend on AI and 5 common questions to answer everything. This is why I'm updating my rating because none of my issues can be addressed."
Good
Excellent
Good 👍
Greedy app sabotaged my work day by cramming three other passengers with ride share then proceding to drop them all off first. Customer service is an idiot who keeps copy pasting bs and gives a $5 Uber credit for a wasted 22$ trip. At this point that could buy me a day pass on the local bus! This companies a greedy joke please use any other alternative!
Uber is great!

We had a good ride
As I'm writing this...I have been waiting for the ride to be confirmed since 30 mins...I booked like 4 rides..all in vein...one cancelled it in the last moment..the service is getting worse and worse pls work on it..
Excellent 👌
Since so many years I was using uber and I was having good experience with it but since 1 wk I am trying to book uber to go office almost 4- 5 drivers cancelled the ride. Really horrible service now a days and not able to reach customer care immediately on the phone call.Uber should not do tie up with such auto drivers. Once I will check if the uber resolve this issue then I can reinstall the app and book cabs again. Other reviews are from other places in mumbai also need such services.
he is good app
I'm from Bangalore Here uber drivers are with rude behaviour and worst at morning times and also they will use foul language too which is not available to forgive if we complain about it no one take care rating is nothing drivers are rude with north and south people
good auto good app but little mistake is do not book in website only book in the app .... in the website there are so many mistake cant able to massage or if your not register number u cant call and main thing was the location mine and auto was showing wrong so that i cant able find the auto so i cancel it i got 15rs fine

"Worst app to book a cab. There was a glitch in their app. I had paid the drive via cash but that same amount got added to my next ride. Hence, I had to pay extra money for my second ride. There's no resolution from their side yet. It's been days reaching out to them. Please use Rapido in india, their customer support service is superb unlike uber where they don't even bother to understand the issue."

Comfortable ride.
Third class services in morning tried too many time every option to book but useless....even 0 rating not deserve....and one more thing if I am booking any cab and driver coming from parking than asking parking charge from my side ....????if his vehicle park in parking than its uber and driver concern why customer????
تطبيق سيئ اطلب اكثر من مرة والسائق ما يتحرك من مكانه لمدة 5 دقائق ولما الغي الطلب يحملنى فلوس الغاء الطلب

"Not a little bit.I want,If the drivers will well experience and well behaved."

Worst Experience while booking auto ride. The driver accepted my trip and made me wait for him and to my shock after reaching he is telling price is less will you give extra money I will come...what kind of brokers you are hiring for jobs ?? Wasting my time seriously?? I need to report this to uber help me how to do that .
Worst experience ever.. Booked a cab for the airport. The payment was done by UPI and trip was completed but not it shows pending amount. Neither any of the help suggestions works nor the Uber wants to resolve this issue due to which I'm not able to book shuttle or cab.
Very good
Uber has never let me down.
The trip was very excellent 👌.
Nice app for travelling both long and short distance but one concern is that cabs sometimes are quite too expensive to afford
"Useless app , irritating by calling daily"
Good service ever

Very good reached in time
I been having issues with double charges to account after ride hrs later and don't know what's going on just frustrated
Starting was good but after few months they charge useless penelety which is more then the trip amount ... Mene continue 2 days is app se cab book Kiya for medical emergency 1st day was good but 2nd day same address but us location tk aaye hi ni or ride cancel krne ko bola mene cancel Kiya to penelety ke di ₹131 ki same return me bhi yahi hua very bad experience I'm going to delete this app and never use it again 😡😡
"Uber's service has become highly unreliable. Drivers cancel rides frequently, even after long waits. The app shows inflated prices during peak hours, and estimated arrival times are rarely accurate. Customer support is ineffective, providing little to no resolution for issues. The convenience once promised by Uber is now completely missing, leaving users frustrated and disappointed."
Was my first time ever using Uber was very nice thank you
Good far
Better experience
You guys are cheated with the customer..my last ride from nayapatty chock mondir to Bananta Water Tank.. when I was book the car showing the price rs 439 and when I came to my destination it's showing rs 498. How come this type of fare...

THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND SUPPORT UBER 🙏"

"Train ticket retrieval still slow. Please can you advise as to why the ability to add travel tickets, in particular UK train tickets, to Google wallet has been removed. The option used to be there at the end of the purchase transaction but has vanished, even under the view ticket section. Having to dig around for a PDF or reley on having a good mobile signal to your app can display the ticket's is just a huge step backwards in useability. Please bring this extremely useful feature back"
Nice ride and very understanding pilot

Best service and they should think more about the pricing for cab rentals.
Fantastic
Charged bank account uber wasn't booked 😒 yous need to make it easier for customers to contact yous
Time to long any time
"We booked uber mini for our last trip which was showing Rupees 465 for the trip but we were shocked to see the amount of 757 but didn't got any help from driver as he is 100% fraudster & did some changes in our ride's payment+now after paying the amount of 757 which he showed us,now it's showing the left balance payment of 101...have booked many trips before too but very much disappointed with this last trip..I request Uber to pay back my extra amount of 292"
Best service
UBER is BEST for all the CUSTOMERS. RIDERS DRIVERS ARE GENUINE EDUCATED AND WELL MANNERED. UBER DRIVERS ARE GOOD. OTHER COMPETITORS ARE DOWNGRADE LOW QUALITY. ONCE A UBER DRIVER SAID " UBER CUSTOMERS ARE LIKE - PRIME CUSTOMERS "
Cancel ride
Nice
Fare is higher side most of the day. Otherwise it's good
Reliable and low fare

"Free trial user beware. If you try to cancel a day or two before Uber one renewal, it won't let you cancel the buttons go away because it says you're close to your renewal date. Scam!"
Good service
Uber has changed for the WORST over the past recent years. They way over charge every passenger and charge insane surge type prices on riders from the Airports and events all while drastically reducing driver pay and then guilting passengers into feeling the need to tip and tip excessively to supplement the drivers pay FOR UBER who is screwing us BOTH! All put in place and enforced by the above stated pirate screw the customers and drivers billing practices. Uber started as a good idea then..
Good job 👍

Best of the best
"The feature to switch mode of payment has been redundant in India since the launch of the app. It is high time that Uber fix this bug. This leads to a high number of cancelations and drivers insisting on going directly without the app to meet their minimum cost. For riders this becomes difficult no one wants to be unfair to the drivers but, this also comes at the cost of safety of the riders."
Great 👍
Very worst app I haven used don't use this app for auto bookings it is showing 31rs for 2 persons and at last after droped me he was saying 60rs worst app and driver

"The fare has been updated up to three times from the regular due to high demand. Having a pickup from Ahmedabad railway station to my home was a bad experience for me. I got a fare of 148/-, but then the fare was raised to 450/- due to high demand. The intention behind this was to deceive customers and make additional income from the situation. Uber is not my recommendation."

"Pathetic support , amount auto deduct from card and no reversal, driver came 10-15 mins no issue, we delay 3-5 minutes additional charges...for improper response"
Cool
Got the lost baggage very quickly through the app
Have been booking rides in Uber almost daily since last October/November. Observed not only booking amount going up significantly but also drop in service quality overall. Honestly a very dissatisfied customer. I don't know if that matters to Uber. Have complained through other official channels as well.
Best ride app
👌
Worst app. No driver accept the ride and then after accepting and wasting 10-15 mins they cancel the ride at their own end. Worst than worst app and service it has started.
"Uber drivers can be wonderful but the app itself leaves much to be desired. Choosing the source or destination address involves a finicky user interface wherein one feels like fighting the app to achieve the desired ride is the only way to get anywhere. The 'reserve a ride' feature is also quite disappointing- the ride almost always arrives 10 or 15 minutes earlier than reserved, and this makes the cancellation policy obscene- I had to rush carrying five bags only to have the driver cancel."
Vekar
Very reliable service
Nice
Worst app Auto and cab not available at night whenever needed Shows long waiting time
On time pick up
Not very good experience.. Almost every driver ( except few ) stand at there comfort location and asked me to come there... If I have to go to the driver then why I booked car/ bike and paying extra money?? Except that almost every driver demanded extra money. I am a regular custom but I have to tell your customer service is very bad.
Very nice
It is too helpful as we get auto or cab from our location...but i have one request cant we upgrade uber as if some people are ill or specially for the preganant lady we can hire a driver who can drive actualy very carefully...and also uber should hav ean option
"Por culpa de el último Uber que me hizo esperar 10 minutos antes de cancelarme el viaje sin motivo, perdí el último bus del día con destino a mi ciudad y quedé varada a 3 horas de distancia, haciéndome perder tiempo y el dinero en el ticket de bus que tenía comprado. El soporte ignora completamente mi solicitud de ayuda a pesar de yo tener Uber One, y nadie se hace responsable por el mal rato y la pérdida de tiempo y dinero. Los Uber cancelan cuando se les da la gana sin ninguna consecuencia."
Enjoy the discounts
At a time of emergency if you are not available what's the purpose of cab then.... Worst app ever
"Because of Amazon pay add appearing on the uber screen continuously, it was not possible to check the real time location of the cab, nor it was possible to talk to driver. There was no option to remove the add. It was not possible to cancell the trip also. Hence waited for more than 15 minutes and took other means of conveyance. Some how I could manage to catch my flight, travelled by an auto. Please remove that add otherwise cutomers have to switch over to Ola. Worst experience ever with Uber."

Good sometimes but I really got to get a car
"Worst experience with Rental and uber chat support today, travelled 38 km but app charged for 53 km. Support service not ready to understand this. If your map is not working, its your concern, it should not pay by customer, no where mentioned additional convenience fee. Uber user ,be aware when booking rental with uber."
"I've been fooled by the courier delivery agent, he took money for my ride and took my food parcel and vanished, I've been calling him In the number provided to contact the agent, it doesn't connect to him, and my order is still ongoing I can't find help support cos it shows only after the order is delivered. What a pathetic service. Extremely disappointed."

Service is too good
Will use lift when ever possible because these guys intentionally made it difficult to cancel a ride - even when the wait time is ridiculous
GOOD
Sbse Ghatiya Application Hai....Jb Jrurt Hoti h jb ride kbi bhi confirm nhi krte...time bht lete hai...
Good
Such a worst app for customer service!!
No words
1) make it kinda harder to cancel rides by asking you many times. i distinctly remember cancelling a ride only to look at my phone and see that the driver was waiting for me. now I have to pay cancellation fees even tho i cancelled during the matching process before a driver was assigned to me. 2) more expensive that other platforms.
prices are good but we as a customer feel that rider doesn't accept the ride easily.
Perfect! Better then taxi
He's so accomodating and drive safely
Verry good
Good
Uber keeps giving the longest route to my destination and upcharging. My destination is 35 mins away but uber keeps giving the route that is 1 hour long. I can't even change the route pin or anything. The do not have a customer service rep that you can speak with either!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good!! Thjgs were goo6
Good
"I hate this company, drivers run a gang to artificially drive up prices and ratings don't do anything. I hate that I have to use this."
Al dsr la opción de pagar con efectivo los conductores aveces dan que te bajas sin pagar y después tienes saldo a dever en la app y te cobran doble.
Rest full ride
Need a ride there always on time*
"Payment issues are at the peak. You cannot switch cash to UPI while you are on ride, You cannot select any payment mode except cash before ride. Don't know what is the issue."
Nice !
Superb journey
In app adds even if I pay for the premium membership? Ridiculous
"My experience was fine... I was a bit surprised at the cost for one person, however. Diego was a good driver and I tipped him well. I will definitely use Uber again. 😙"
Good service
"Antes era buena app, actualmente te cancelan el viaje varias veces antes de tomar un viaje realmente, o si te toman se demoran mas de 20 minutos en llegar, una burla."
"Ordered a shake, and had the wring address by accident, i tried to change address but had to call the driver told him my location, he said he couldn't make it to my location because he is in bycicle, so i tried cancelling order but had no way of cancelling it, wasted my 10 quid"
Vahiyat....not good application....UBER make costumer as fool...no cab or auto come in 20 or 30 min....please use rapido
Uber is a complete rip-off. They murdered the taxi cab. Now they they overcharge people and underpay the driver. Complete bs Donald Trump needs to lay the hammer down on these delivery services
Perfect 👌 👍 🥰
Uber is tripping big time. Booking fees are the same as the fair ride or more. 14 dollars for a booking fee is ridiculous. Price gouging at it's finest. I won't be using Uber anymore.
Super
"The driver of the car with license plate TG850G drove right past me and canceled the trip. I was waiting for this ride for more than 20 minutes. Afterwards, there were no drivers available. Ended up getting very late to work."

This young man was a pleasure to meet and a good driver. Thanks again 👍
So frustrating trying to tell it when and where I want to be and go. It took many attempts to get my ride set up. That was after it wouldn't let me do Google pay or enter my info without weird overlays blocking my view.

Sucks how drivers call to ask where you are and where you are going when it is already in the trip. And then they say they are on the way only to realise they cancelled. Uber in Kenya sucks

"Uber services have become pathetic over a period of time. The company has just become a money minting service for its promoters. The drivers ask anything over and above the fare. They also provide local uber office location and dare you to approach uber. Even if you approach uber, it just provides funny explanations. After experiencing world class services of uber, I have closed my uber account and returned to good old days of hailing an auto or calling local taxi services."
Use it He will help another... Side
From last week while I am opening the app they automatically booking my ride as per the last details which were mentioned and the ride is not cancelling.
Too much money goes to Uber for the transaction that its very expensive and the drivers don't even get paid that much

"Awful support, daughter abandoned on a dark road late at night by driver. Customer support are clearly corporate protection and not customer service focused. Try a different app if you care for you and yours safety"
Very good and respectful driver. But I think the app is a little complicated for the average Ghanaian. There should be an easy way to find option to share the ride with a loved one with just a click
Time taking and not proper service. I am trying to book a cab from half hour still not accepting my booking
Fantastic and exceptional

Its works perfectly in Qatar and is way easy to go around
THE DRIVER WAS VERY NICE & A SAFE DRIVER I WILL GIVE THS DRIVER A 5 STAR SERVICE...
First experience is last experiece of uber ride. Auto ride shown 65 rs. but charged it 100 from me...worst app💯
All rights
Great
It works great but I can't trust the app anymore. There are way too many scammers on the app and it seems like Uber is lax with people using other people's accounts. Customer service isn't much help either unfortunately.
Acha
You guys are very incompetent sometimes. Why is it so hard to locate the riders
Ab Uber driver misbehaved and throughout the journey kept misbehaving .. asked to cancel the ride n get down in the middle of the highway... He said on our face that why don't we all use our personal vehicle why use uber .. n when we complain to the uber customer care they didn't take any required action... Uber will not black list such driver or fine them for misbehaving or harassing anybody this is what I experienced.. it happened in pune and journey was from talegaon to ravet..
"Extremly poor app, when I am going to book always asking to pay 63.60 for what should I pay. Till they will not rectify i cant use this app as this is a fraud with pessengers"
Very helpfull
"Trying to get in touch with someone to complain tjat i have been waiting for over 2h and i cant get a hold of no one, the number on the confirmation when i try to call tells me i have been blocked .. thank you 😡😡😡😡"
Ok
Easy to Book much better than other apps.
nice premium promotion/program that applies to food and taxi 2 for 1
fare's are too high. m looking upto 40kms distance but uber is asking for triple fare of the distance. n m daily user still it's very high.
I installed and Booked the cab. However the App showed me initially showed me an amount which was reasonable but after the trip it showed me 30% Increase in total fare. It's a straight forward cheating case. Really a Horrible experience with these cheaters.
Don't install this uber app.. totally waste of time because drivers no one accepting online payment but you are giving online discount then why this offer ... And there is complaint number and customer service... Totaly waste service.. without proper customer service then why you running this service...I can't able to complaint against drivers and no one giving proper solution.. so please give me any suggestions to provide before one star so that I will minus star to this worst service
Just in time
Nice one
"Uber bans you for being a polite rider apparently. I am waiting for my ride, I give tips. I am nice. I just take rides to work but I guess it's bad? Lyft will continue my business"
"I see Uber is price gauging yet again, $12-$18 dollars for 5-15 minute ride is a bit excessive. Once again, people rely on this service for school, work and other priority destinations, spiking the prices in this way is an insult to the customers and likely to send them to find another service. In this economy, a ride shouldn't be overpriced. There needs to be some revision in pricing."

"El taxista me estafó, colocó que yo pagué menos de lo que el mencionó. Presenté mi voucher antes el centro de ayuda de Uber y teniendo el comprobante en donde estipula que yo pagué completo NO ME HICIERON CASO. Tan bajo es su nivel de seguridad que siguen permitiendo que estafadores estén bajo su app, terrible 0/10."
Excellent service and an asset to the Company
"Reliable and fair pricing ,internationally."

Really disappointed with service and the riders are unprofessional and they use bad language after accepting the ride they don't come and tell us to cancel Uber don't have any safety.... I raised a complaint but they didn't solve it but in rapido is we raise any complaint they will solve immediately... Uber is worse....
"The support is terrible. They charged me twice on the Uber One. I asked to fix it and they just cancelled my Uber One without any refund. Theirs bots are really stupid! I hope they are bots because if they are human, it is a shame."

"The drivers are fine. The customer service is non existent specifically when trying to correct payment errors where, for example, a payment option is deselected, but charged anyway. This is a very poorly run company that ultimately can be rendered obsolete by any competent competitor."
God no. This is the worst app. No proper map routes. No customer support. To much prices for small distances. During nights don't even ask. Share rides are the worst. Co riders who join after you gets to be dropped first. You will sit for hhr to hr for a 10 to 15 mins journey. I really hope there will be another company who will start a similar competitive company. (BTW I have used Uber for almost 5 years) I would really ignore it if there was another mode of transport to my destination.

Very bad experience unnecessary deduct money
Reliable and timescale and easy tovl use with good prices
"Terrible app for people with Adhd or tend to be forgetful!!!!!!! I left something brand new in a taxi and I had to PAY £20 to get it back! Not only that, once your trips ended you can no longer contact them to let them know!! They 10000% would have kept it, no doubt in my mind, and it was for work and was expensive, I do not recommend the prices go up and down like crazy yes it's good when it's cheap but its not good when it goes to 58 pound for a £15 trip! They seemed nice in the car till that"
Good
No response is app is very froud
"All the drivers in uber are charging extra for every ride i have taken using uber, rapido and ola are not doing so. It's shows little more amount than uber but are true amount. Uber amount are false."
"Hello Uber Team, I am experiencing an issue with a payment that is still reflecting in my Uber account, even though the payment was already made to the driver. Because of this issue, I cannot use the application. Additionally, when I tried to contact the call center, I did not receive any response. This is my first time facing such an issue, and I find it very irresponsible. Please check with the driver and ensure that this payment is cleared from my Uber account."
Bad service I book another place but he drop me another place very bad don't use this app

Worst experienced !!! I booked a share Uber the fare was 33qr. Then someone booked after that she didn't show up. I asked the driver maybe my fare will be high? He said no the same 33qr. When I reached to my location the fare that I need to pay is 63qr. Im really disappointed what happened. I reported it to the Uber I sent an email and message but no reply and no action.

Worst app and the worst Dev's who designed it. First it's not a banking app why the hell you guys logout the account again and again. Even when logging in it pathetic to ask password and OTP EVERTIME? wth? What's anyone gonna do hacking my uber acc? Book a ride to rob a bank 😂? C'mon uber you gotta remove this again and again login feature and keep a single login better is OTP and your otp system usually don't work so in that case use password 🙏 plz
It awesome but m your regular rider so please provide good discount 🤪😜
"Even with Uber one subscription the fare estimates shown to me were much higher (at times $10+) than others for the same distance, route and time. For Uber eats order, items were missing and despite multiple complaints, there was no resolution. So basically, I paid extra for uber one membership, higher rates for ride and for food items which were missing in my order without any resolution. I wish I could give a 0 rating!"
Mast
So comfortable
"I took an Uber un mexico and paid to driver in cash (never had an issue in Argentina with this). The driver marked the trip as not paid. I disputed with Uber and my trip was marked as paid, but now the Uber says the trip wasn't paid and I have to pay on next trip. And all the links to support inside app say ""you have already received your money"""

"Very fast response, excellent work experience was very nice"
Schofield needs to have options that are on base. Maybe it encourages drivers to get visitors passes so they can get on. The nearest gate to me maybe miles away from the nearest driver. But otherwise a fantastic app that enabled those without cars. Fort Cavazos was way more efficient than Schofield btw.
Waste app ...😡🤬 driver's are not accepting rides ... worst experience with this app
I have lost my mobile on car on 1 December...driver said he had given to next customer who sits after us....so pls find my mobile as soon as possible.....there is no customer care number to contact...

Nice service and good attitude by driver to help us p
Very nice app
Fraud app. They show different fare before ride booking and then charge whatever they want once ride ends. And there's no use of complain as well.
My fair has almost doubled in the last month and nothing has changed in terms of my journey. Uber is biting the hand that feeds them. Alternative is arranged. Bye bye 👋 uber.
Very Bad Experience. Just wasted my time and money on them would recommend other apps over them. Was not willing to give even 1 star but had to... sadly. Didn't expect them to hire such cheap drivers. Yuck×infinite.

Good app but sometimes it's hard as hell to get a ride plus a lot of drivers like to take your ride then have u wait and then they cancel at the last min and it's not fare to us cause when we book a ride and then we cancel it we get charged a cancellation fee but again when the driver does it what perk do we get NOT A DAMN THING

Eu fiquei de 23:30h até 1:00h solicitando um carro e esse aplicativo sempre me dando um novo tempo de espera para depois começar a procurar um motorista. E também querendo empurrar um serviço mais caro? informando que o Uber x não tem motorista disponível. No meio do processo um tinha aceito mas cancelou depois de um tempo. Acabei pegando o transporte público depois. Esse app e seu serviço só está cada vez pior. Aqui no Rio de Janeiro tem concorrências melhores como o 99 app e até táxi.
Cabs been way to much for a ride home and to work everyday. Can it get cheap sometimes please.
in NYC it grossly underestimates your travel time
"Someone needs to remind them that taxi cabs don't charge surge fees.... my ride is $15 dollars plus tip, I have multiple receipts from multiple cab companies. Under no circumstances can you justify $54 before tip. Stay in school and don't do drugs"

I don't know whose at the fault for the situation I faced the amount generated after the ride is completely different from when booking and it's non negotiable after completing the ride I had to pay extra after my ride I had all these issues previously and literally stopped using uber and I just installed it back days before and the 3rd ride on justgave me a reason not to use it again and the thing is the price hike is only showing on the driver end and not mine and he did talk rude about it too

Total Fraud I have charged two bill bills. Actul bill for ₹177 and another for ₹ 66.46 this way Uber charged me Rounded of amount ₹52.51. This is terrific fraud. This app shoud be banned
"The app and getting all of it to request a ride is absolutely awful, it's difficult but the driver was a very nice gentleman and he drove great. If the can make the process to request a ride easier and more efficient I will use again but if don't change the process I will use someone else."
"I had a terrible experience with the Uber app today. I requested an UberX, and after 6 minutes, the app showed I was ""on board"" even though I hadn’t been picked up. There was no way to report it, and the driver claimed it was a glitch. After 30 minutes of hassle, I booked another ride but couldn’t cancel without a fee. The second ride was so far away and took longer than estimated. Worse, I’ve been charged three times for just two rides. This situation is unacceptable and frustrating."

"Just once, literally one single time I would be happy if you did this, you can give me actual pickup time estimates instead of double that amount after I've confirmed a ride but before I can cancel it and use something else like Lyft? Update: several months later, this is still a thing. From a one minute pickup on the order screen, to a nine minute wait once confirmed. Do better. Update: a 10 minute $100 pickup magically turns into a 22 minute wait. Wild. Classic bait-and-switch."

Way better and safer than bolt. The cars are clean and the drivers are nice.
Best Rider App Best Price 💯👍
Great trips
UBER do not have control on their cab drivers. I will say zero control and they don't care about customer issues. Cab drivers cancel ride as per their convenience after booking. And it's a regular feature. My yesterday experience was also similar 3 rides cancelled by driver before I get 4th attempt. Uber is not fit for services
Excellent Service my first time won't be the last
Another day of waiting ages for an uber for them to cancel or just keep us waiting again. Thanks for stranding me AGAIN.

It takes really really long to connect to a driver. And sometimes they dont even find any drivers near
Very nice person
Everytime I try to book a ride the app closes on its own. Uber needs to update their maps. This app frustrates me!!!!
I have booked the ride by 4 30 then the driver reached the location by 4 10 and that time called me that he reached then I had asked him to wait for 20 mins and he said OK too but I got late by 10 mins and he cancelled the ride without even connecting with me once and then Uber charged me the charges too and then there is no system to type this type of review for that ride. Such disgusting so unfair
He was a good man cheers prem
I love using Uber
"Trash all the way through..... literally standing there when the driver shows up but still get charged a waiting fee, HOW?????🛑 Check your bank Acc.

Their prices are equal to the other large operation that has pink letters. As a rule anytime I'm using those services i check both to see who's cheaper as they alternate."
Good
Update: worst customer service ever!!! They just close your tickets without resolution. Virtually hang up on you.
"excellent, fantabulous"
"My trips are long and drivers ask what's the destination and cancel. Or they show up, pull up the address and cancel the trip when they see the address. If your drivers don't want to work, send them home. They're worthless..."
1st ride... fantastic!!
very good 💯😊
"Awesome in New York City, as always."
Takes ages to get a ride
"The customer support has always been terrible, but for the last couple months it has somehow found a way to become abysmally worse. Issues that used to be a matter of navigating an obnoxiously complex menu have become an issue of having to wait for an unresponsive support team that doesn't do anything to repair issues faced by their customer base. Absolutely horrendous company. If you're in a position to never do business with them, avoid them like the plague they are."
Good work
Good driver legit clean car everything went good
Good
Very comfortable
This app is horrible the diver arrive after 5 min but in the app it was given 2min but when app is showing arrived but the diver is not here yet . Diver's car number is ( 4342) This happens with this diver but else This app is not good 😐 the worse to worst 😑.
"If you ever need to contact support, good luck, no one to help you except endless bot messages sending you to a help article page"
Driver are too slow and giving excuses and wrost part is that app is charging us... For cancellation
"The driver was polite, personable,professional and an excellent driver!!"
In Bangalore the auto drivers are asking more money to go somewhere but the uber make the trip low price but I security thank you so much
"I have been trying to cancel my Uber One membership for a week. When you try to cancel, it continues to direct you to pausing your membership. Then, after jumping through those hoops, it makes you contact a representative for 'help' to cancel. 5 days later, I finally hear back from a 'representative' only to be asked if I would like to pause my membership for 1 month or 2....I WANT TO CANCEL!! This issue is still unresolved, and it feels like a very slimey tactic to keep me paying."

Uber I ordered and waited for suddenly disappeared from the app leaving me to pay more for a priority one. Not the first time.... Uber usually more expensive than local firms. Driver and journey fine but the company does not impress.
"I have only had best experience,low fares and short arrival time of the driver, definitely recommend."
Good riding option for family

Amazing...app faster pick up shortly time Thanks uber ❤❤

"Ripoff Uber eats prices, they might as well change double."
Nice
The drivers are OK. It's the app that keeps charging me for rides I haven't requested or even charge me twice for ONE Ride. It's really infuriating.
"very annoying, I wish I could give zero (no) star. customer care ""Mikee"" is a very poor representative of Uber, I must say. why would Uber want to charge me twice for a ride? I called customer service, and the above-mentioned name was so sluggish"
Good 👍

"I was charged for cancellation of trip for no responce of driver for longer period and second time the trip was cancelled by driver. I was penalty 57 an 40 rupees these amount were collected by next trips, kindly avoid use this app because they penalise the commuters regularly....."
RANJEET KUMAR BEST SERVICE
"This app does exactly the things I want it to do in the exact ways I want it to do them. It's also good about introducing me to new features, intuitively. All-in-all I now understand the success of Uber as a whole. Highly recommend."
Excellent experience :)
"Easy to use, great service..."
"Lovely lady smooth trip, thank you!"
Beautiful experience so far...
"Cheat Drivers be it for cab booking or delivering packages. All goons and nothing else. I doubt Uber KYC/onboarding corrupt process for hiring such culprits. Uber app. is deliberate designed shows cabs when you confirm booking but they surely have no controls over their drivers who even accept booking when they are even more than 30 min away, hence, all crooks scratching each other's back and loot in the he name of fake generated demand fare making you wait Uber One is no different in behaving!"
They took my money for the ride then called the ride and kept my money. Just use Lyft it actually works and they won't rob you l.
Nice
"Very poor service... If you do not have control on your driver's, you should shut down your services. You take five minutes in connecting with driver. User wait for another ten minutes for selected drivers. And two three minutes before, he cancels booking."
No complaints
Love the app and convenient application

Spot on time and Tracy is What you would expect from a Professional!
Superb !!!
It is unreal to reach customer support! System made the worst way possible and takes forever to use! No way I am going to use Uber again.
Some drivers are not accepting ride and demand for extra money
Respectful driver. Thank you
Affordable....most driver's are professional
Worst Service according to me
Very good service
Very gud experience

Taking cab rides to another level
Poor services
Good quick trip
Varye bad Uber
Osm service
"Really saved the day..... Swift pick up, polite staff"
I am good
It is not as it used to be. It takes too long to find a trip and many drivers are rude and unprofessional. It seems that Uber don't care about the passengers' experience anymore
Never ever use Uber package / courier. A bunch of cheats and fraudsters. You may lose something too valuable. The best part is they will keep telling you what the driver said and will refuse to even understand your part.
Good
"Ubers prices feels ""made up as we go"" I understand there are increases in demand But 3X is insane Also their customer service is dog shxt The way the manage car crashes are outrageous They are very reluctant when it comes to refunding you if you were to cancel a trip (I'm referring to canceling before the driver is even close to you, drivers that take way too much time than necessary)"
Uber Shuttle booking is not happening and asking uber payment option to change. Worst app and worst company. Every time driver issues are there. Very unsafe. No complaint management. Extra charges and wrong charges are there in every journey. Uber is most inconvenient. Criminal type of drivers are there and UBER is sucking money using such drivers.
"Very positive, 10 min wait ,driver on time , skilled and polite."
"The newest update, forcing you to pay fo priority (unless you plan on waiting well over the standard time for you ride) makes the app useless. My Ubers keep cancelling, meaning it can take over 30 minutes to be picked up. I can only assume that because I am not paying for priority none of the drivers can be bothered to pick me up, preferring to wait for closer priority-paying customers. Please remove this greedy, app-debilitating feature. Thanks"
"Fast reliable and safe I use it for my older relatives and it saves me time and effort. Pick up are usually within the estimated time, all in all, I'm very satisfied."
سائق محترم جدا
"Prompt, friendly service."

"Shocking that a driver can accept a ride. Then reject it as another might come in which they prefer, leaving you stuck once a driver accepts a job that should be binding. Shocking service."
When u need in emergency To much waiting tym After waiting Cab driver cancelled the cab

Wonderful!!!!
Likes to charge you without actually getting you transport charges me 60 dollars for a ride to cancelle and not refund.
Reserve a ride feature is awesome and I'm living it alot!😋
Perfect

"Their is literally no ubers at all in Busselton WA after it even says on google that uber supports 24/7 in any towns or cities all over Australia and Busselton is a pre amazing town that is very much loved by alot of travellers all around not just Australia but the world too, maybe your company UBER should really look into it as I've had to request over 3 times daylight and at night time too and it was pre important to be able to get an uber an it never happened I had to order a taxi😔‼️."
Wow
🙃🙃🙃🙃
Good
App unclear
Awesome
Very good driver and very good service
Great App... Love updates
Was good and comfortable and so calming as he agreed to play the music
An unacceptable bug occurred. I requested a ride to my home and the app simply displayed the location of where I was. It charged the price of the address I wanted for an address I did not request (it listed my current location as the dropoff). Then I changed the address and it simply charged me double. I no longer use the app so I don't run the risk of having to pay double again.
Drivers are very slow to turn up now so they can upsell you a more expensive trip. Very cynical.
Great experience. Driver was fantastic.
Very bad services
"I had my phone and bank card stolen, so now I can never use uber again, apparently. When you login to Uber, they ask you for the CVV of your bank card. That card is long gone, and there is no option to change the card info. I tried emailing uber to have this resolved, and all I got was an auto generated message telling me to access the helpdesk. However, I CAN'T access the helpdesk without logging in. What a stupid set of protocols"
Good
wonderful app
Good experience
"Prices are getting to high, switched to Lyft."
bikers not catching on time
Very good survice
Very good service and good response from driver amazing ride and reasonable price
"This app is good for nothing, it's take too much time for booking 👎"
I work as Ticket Collector at Uber Parking for Dubai Airports.
"Can't find rides on weekends anymore, causing me to be late. It used to be so easy to get a ride, and I'm in a busy area near a major city. Saturday mornings you have to order your Uber like 45 minutes before you want to arrive at your destination, because they'll take 15 minutes to find you someone...who's a half hour away. What the heck?"
Price high
Good
Great stuff thanks
Good service
Very good. We are very satisfied.
Good job ✌✌✌
Absolutely loved it drivers are kind and caring and love to have a chat
"Some additional amount is shown to the passenger before booking the vehicle and after arrival the amount is immediately increased and presented to the customer. This is very bad behavior of Uber people, first I booked Ola cab but after its sudden closure I started booking cab from Uber but Ola never did such scam as Uber has done. Please keep in mind that whatever amount is shown to the customer by Uber should remain the same in the end because these small amounts are very profitable for Uber"
Good app
"even if the driver cancels the ride , why should I pay any kind off tax , worst app ever"
Fast service
"One of the best user friendly apps I have ever used. At the airport in a foreign country found the pickup place, time, car, driver without any issues... Other companies should look up to Uber."
Everything was good
"Of all the drivers of Uber, what does number one say? There is a desire to give a street, no one takes booking."
I like the service
Worst
Driver cancel
Bloody worst app useless and unreliable.
Shite takes ages to try to find a ride now
Good service
Very good
Takes ages and cancels a lot.
👍🏻
lowering the driver's pay while leaving a hole in the customer's wallet.
Best driving
The worst app ever ..... Not even a single ride booked since morning
"I am forced to pay for an amount of an order that I canceled within a minute. I refuse to pay for it. I've sent numerous messages to support, and no ever comes back to me."
Best experience on time parcel received

"In Germany, was waiting for ""Locate your driver"" several times. Then was asking me to pay an extra cost for priority to find a driver. Guys if you do not operate in an area or you have no available drivers just say ""Sorry, no drivers at your area""."
when you first use the app the prices are reasonable but after a few weeks. They triple in price it's ridiculous for people who use this to get to and from work.
"First time I've used it, but won't be the last. Flawless and convenient."
Awesome work keep progressing
Affordable price and best ride
Very useful
"Words will not cover the disappointment I have experienced with them today. Apparently am supposed to pay before I get to my destination, before I even see the vehicle and before they confirmed the ride or pick up."

Worse
Very bad app don't book any rides from this app
"They openly cheat customers and lie about upfront pricing. They add all kinds of extra fees they add in at the end. Review your bill always. You have to keep disputing these cheats for their predatory cheating add ons. Also their priority pricing is an evil joke, often coming after rideshare. These people are unethical cheats mocking us"
Nice App
Worst app. All the drivers are cancelling the ride and charges imposing on users ...
Professional

I have a business account and cannot get any assistance
"Always looking to charge u more. 620am the charge showed $10, I tried to process the ride...ofcourse it diesnt go through and next attempt for the exact same ride maaaaybe 2 minutes later and uber charges 50% more for that same ride. Time to go back to Yellow 🚕🚖🚕🚖🚕"

"Sometimes it keep saying we are connecting you in 5, 6, 7 minutes and after such await the riders cancel the order. If that can be changed?"

"Useless app. No proper means to connect with customer support for an upcoming trip. Vehicle arrived for my trip. However, the driver is not able to start the trip due to a glitch in his uber app. He is not able to cancel the trip. Even I am not able to cancel the ride without charges. Bad customer support."

Extra charge but uber not responding
This guy is so nice. I like the way he drive nice and easy. Thank you so much
Uber is a safe way of transportation
Punctual. No cancellations by them. Compare to other service providers it is good.

Always have friendly drivers that make sure I'm safe
All good
Very good experience I appreciate thank you
"Terrible experience with Uber South Africa. I have forgotten my keys in the Uber. From the moment I have tried the option to contact the driver, his number does not exist. Clearly Uber does not screen their drivers. I have offered a reward to get my keys back, I have pleaded and tried everything. Uber support does not care and does nothing to help me. They are now ignoring me. If this is how they treat a their customers, do not expect any help from them for a more serious incident."
Very good service
Lacking so much
Good service
I love
The drivers ask for more money always. And they are very disrespectful. I had a lot of experiences in Guwahati
Very polite and very professional
Way too expensive for short rides
Best app as compared to ola and rapido
"Delivering wrong parcel, making customers in trouble and cheating them by taking their money. Customer care says to talk to local authorities instead of asking help from them that too the problem which they have created. Never use this app for any type of rides, especially parcel."
Good company
Bait and switch pick up times
I love to ride with uber
"The app has become worse over the years. There is no customer service - only a poorly written chat but that only understands basic issues. It won't submit a support request either. During one recent case, my pickup was was quoted at 5 minutes. After requesting, it jumped to 20 minutes. It took 35 minutes. There was no reason and no recourse. One of the worst apps ever, these days."
Drivers are late and can just ignore you because they have a technical issue. Ride price changes in the middle of the ride. There are better alternatives indeed
The Worst app you can ever imagine They can't even book a ride even after paying in cash. Its not even capable of booking.
"I recently redownloaded the app after getting a new phone, intending to continue using the service. However, the constant barrage of notifications and emails - sometimes multiple times a day, urging me to book my ""first"" ride was overwhelming. I decided to uninstall the app, unsubscribe from their emails and switch to Bolt instead. Way to chase away a long-term user of your service - I'm not sure who thought this approach was a good idea..."
Very good👍👍👍
Very useful
What is this my minimum distance ride ammount 73rs. And other get rs. 35 to 45 for minimum distance ride. What the hell with you Uber. WTH still showing double amount from others users. What you think about it. I think uber for you every user are not equal.
"Good but the taxi rider some of them have to be more professional, they have to avoid smoking and using mobile during the trip"
You charged me to cancel my ride. Clearly something on your end is not right
Good vehicle.. clean..well behavioed driver
Fast services
"Beware while using this app. This is a scam of the highest level. Your driver will force you to pay in cash when you are done with the trip and then when you do, the app will still ask you for money, when you raise an issue about this, in app support will not help at all and rather keep on going around in circles and keep on asking for more money. They are legit scammers. Beware! Do not get scammed by installing this fraud app. Note: my friend also had similar experience. Be aware. They do this"

"I use Uber in the UK as well as whenever I am in Nigeria. The experience is very good and it is very convenient in so many ways. I know the cost of the journey in advance, and I pay Uber through my bank account. The drivers always turn up on time, and they never charge me any extra money. Uber is the best and most convenient way to move around anywhere in the world. 👌👍❤️"

All the drivers are Canceling hyd airport. Shame
Cheaper and reliable
Damien was excellent and covered all details. He was a professional in all aspects.
Excellent service
Bad location location error location problem
Mostly time fare increase after dropping time
Uber is a great and convenient app ! For me wherever I am I can request and there are always users nearby. But.. Just a small but lol. It's more of a request. Is it possible for the tech team to create a uber pets ? For eg for those who don't drive and would love to take their dogs out for the day like to the park or beach that's would be fantastic and also At a affordable and reasonable price.
"Got charged duplicate amount for my trip, I paid the driver driect through gpay but he had already marked the trip as done.Now I have to suffer for it. Tried to reach out to the support many times but they didn’t resolve my issue also the support team is reaching out Very late and poorly, I even shared the transaction 's screenshot where mine and the drivers upi and number is visible still it didn’t get resolve yet. Worst experience"
Always pleasant
very good
"Simple, fast, efficient, comfortable. Thank you."
Nice first experience
the average cost is honestly just ridiculous not to mention if there any traffic what's so ever automatically 30-50$ for 1 20 min ride do not recommend
👍👍👍👍

very kind and was very kind personable driver.
"I hadn't used Uber for quite some time. My driver was great! The map directions weren't so good, but he kept looking and eventually found the hotel. Thanks so much."
Your service is very slow and the driver does not come on time we are shame to choose Uber
Peter was an amazing driver
Drivers are professional and serive is seamless. Uber can save the day when the rain is hitting hard and you have to get to that appointment and motorcycle isn't an option...
Exceptional
It gets me from point a to point b
I didn't ask for this Thier subscription. Uber has charged me without my permission. Using fishy way to hide subscriptions and difficulties to cancel it through my accounts.
Good service
Thanks for the driver bro
Good

Very bad driver did not take me to my destination but collected the same amount
nice
"I had to pay double. once my ride finish, again in next ride they took money for previous ride."
I had a terrible experience today as no drivers showed up. It seems drivers are avoiding Uber because they’re being paid less and opting for other apps or minicab offices instead. It’s disgraceful that Uber isn’t supporting its drivers and riders properly. This might be the beginning of the end for you if things don’t change.
"Uso esta aplicación para no tener que usar la de Uber Eats también ya que deja usar ambas para los dos servicios pero estoy completamente enojado por el servicio ha que tiene muchos errores de los cuales he reportado y no han dado solución nunca. La atención al cliente es inexistente. Los odio de verdad, me han causado muchos problemas."
Nice driving and reasonable price.
Good app it has taxis and many more. Yesterday we should go to secundrabad station urgently . Their taxi took us very fast to the station before the train started to move.
I cannot connect with the customer support for my problem there is no optionto chat or call... My ride has completed yesterday and yet does not recieved my hold amount which is still kept on hold on my Amazon wallet I need urgent assistance...I am away from my home need the amount to be released urgently This is the last tym I am booking any uber worst experience in terms of payment
Ishdj
I can really appreciate the specifications and options offered for rates and time. I'm 45 and I remember waiting 40 minutes at the least for a cab with no options of seating room and every car feeling like the back seat of a cop cruiser. We have truly advanced in some areas of living and this is one of those things.
Good timing
Nice
"I started using UBER six months ago, and its standard operating procedures are efficient. The drivers arrived early, so I arrived early for my doctor's appointments. The drivers also possess great customer service skills. The PRO is that I no longer rely on public transportation for my medical appointments. The CON is the increased cost to use UBER. At the age of 70 health dilemmas, I had to compromise."
Very good and quick
ELLO A
Super
Very good Uber driver. It would be more useful if the app can provide a portion to note child seats and boosters and or bags carried. It will give driver a good understanding of whether things will fit or not. My driver was very generous and helpful in a lovely way benefited the family travel to Airport.
Good
Friendly and convenient each time I use Uber
On time drop
Bad experience using app Placed order for pickup and they sent a driver to my house with the food -.- i tapped the confirmation for instore pick up and everything. Reached out to customer care and they didnt care got charged an extra 10 dollars and watched my friends eat 😑
Utter ubbish
Super app
Ride cost is not correct when we schedule ride. Cost only shows fare not booking charge. When it comes to pay final bill then Uber is showing extra 100rs. This is really frustrating experience coz just 10 min ago before starting ride i see almost half price of my booking price and then you are charging extra cost on already fixed high cost
Absolute thievery.
Very pathetic service driver took amount & uber still charging me as unpaid amount
Good
Perfect and professional.
Very poor service
Good
Good experience
"Go for other apps. Day by day uber are more into fraud. Uber increases cost at the time we end the ride. It happens more than 50 times, i book ride seeing cost of trip and then when the trip ends..it shows different price...plus price us so high nowadays"
It’s too good
Good sarvesh
garbage
Worst
Greedy company!!
Numerous times I've had to wait an hour to be picked up after work whilst seeing people who ordered after me being picked up. App crashes a lot and notifs for found drivers don't always work
Good
Please show nearby riders only. I'm in hurry and 7 km driver accept my ride. This is really irritating.
Best services of Uber
"Drivers constantly accept and then never arrive, looking for better deals on other apps. Very frustrating customer experience all around."
"App is a little daunting for a first time user, but I was able to sort it out in the end."
"Been using Uber for years and it used to not be so bad, but it's just awful now. Rides that used to cost me $10 now cost $20, seems like no matter what time or day it is they attempt to push predatory tactics to force you into paying more money. 2pm on a Tuesday? It's busier than usual! My 10 min ride to work is now $50 for the next hour! 10-15 wait time? Nope, the only person in the entire city who's available is 35 mins away, apparently, unless I spend extra money for ""priority pickup."""
Ride cancel problem
"I've ordered front Uber Eats a few times, and until now, I've had no issue. Tonight was totally different. My order was missing both drinks. Customer service in this situation is/was virtually nonexistent - difficult to find, incomplete. Driver was rude when contacted about the missing items. For what i paid, I expected much better service. My advice is pay close attention to what is going on. Don't let the driver leave without checking the order first."
"I order a trip in Amsterdam while I happen to be within an Uber-defined exclusion zone, so the pickup point is actually a 10 minutes walk away. Trip gets cancelled by Uber when I'm 100m away from pickup point. I get charged €9.50 for cancelling the trip. I use a taxi. Uber gets 1 star. End of story."
Never available on time pathetic service
Really accurate app
"Always have a good experience, it's always prompt and the drivers are always super courteous and they get me where I'm going on time and safely. I don't have to use Uber often, I can't really afford to use it much but when I do need it I know I can rely on fast service! Thank you!"
Fantastic App
"Antes tenía algo de prestigio y servía, ahora los precios son altos, el servicio al cliente no existe, hacen rebajos a las cuentas bancarias dobles sin poder reclamar, el servicio estándar te hace esperar por un conductor, hay escasez de conductores y un gran etcétera. No recomiendo usarla si no es con efectivo y de no ser ESTRICTAMENTE NECESARIO, el servicio ya no es lo mismo que antes."
Very good
What will we do now without UBER 🤩🤩
App and company useless Overcharged users and give drivers the least amount of payment to make the most of their own profits. Company and profit first over customer and staff. DO NOT USE IF YOU CAN.
Please reach out in Hawkesbury as well 😅😅 do add on TV pz
"Los conductores te pueden robar al pagar en efectivo y terminas pagandolo o desinstalando la app, les invito a que si les hacen fraude acudan a la fiscalia a interponer una denuncia contra de estos encubridores de fraude, les pedí un correo de soporte para mandarles el video de que si había pagado y se negaron a siquiera aceptarme la evidencia, está app necesita una regulación federal"
Very expensive
Please dont include bangali driver
Easy even for an old man
Asom
Uber rides always changed my credit card 💳 after I purchase a ride charging my credit card 💳 extra money 3/ 4 o'clock in the morning hours late after my credit card 💳 and email showing I already paid for my ride.. BAD experience riding with Uber I always have to blocked Uber business from my credit card ACCOUNTS from taken money from my credit card 💳
Nice app
Good and easy of life
"I'm very happy with the app it's safe ,comfortable and the drivers wait outside to make sure you enter your house safe and sound thanks to Uber keep doing the good job we need this as a country"
Nice
"Marius, excellent driver, keen to help in any way he could. Made a tough ride very simple."
super 👌
My first solo Uber ride. It was great. Super friendly driver.
Good app. Would recommend highly.
"Prices have been ridiculous lately and can't get rides, makes it useless"
"Go to lyft. Much more reliable. This app will constantly allow drivers to cancel or sit in parking lots waiting for you to cancel and then charge you a fee bf it was within a certain time frame. They have no humans to communicate with. Only a select choice of prompts to complain about. If your city has taxis use those, if not lyft. Do not use uber"
Great reliable transportation but only gives the drive 50% which is kinda unreasonable but very reliable and great for last minute rides
Good Service 💯
To keep to
Thank you Jonathan
Great service
Good service
horrible app
"Uber drivers just don't accept certain trips. On the last trip, the driver just said they did not want to go to a concert destination and drove off after accepting the trip."
Cheaper than Lyft by a lot
Drivers have no
Great driver
Can no longer see the incoming driver's car when ordering a ride and unable to message
Update (12/06/2024): Company is the most obnoxious business in history. In any world other than clown world they would fined/legislated into extinction & already bankrupt. Oh how I long to read about their CEO getting "Brian Thompsoned" someday. Their latest cuntyness is spamming you with marketing notifications at times that their research indicates will be the MOST irritating or inconvenient. They obviously realize that muting notifications will interfere with the app & most won't bother.
Really. Good service
Have a better experience ride was safe and hastle free.
"I must admit that it is times that I depend in need a ride and me Uber have our ups and downs, advantages and disadvantages but I sincerely do appreciate the drivers and I will continue to support them period there are a few areas that Uber need to tighten up on but I sincerely appreciate the services"
Most Hated app ever seen....... I never got timely booking.......worst service and no option to talk with customer care n all
Exelent drive
Heard about lawsuits and expensive rides so never tried
He is a nice person
Very nice. Tip in cash
"Why is SHARE a ride FIRST NOW???? I booked a shared ride by mistake!!!! I do not share Ubers!! For me it's taboo & uncivilized 🤢🤮. Now I'm charged $5.50 for the mistake. What is SHARE 1st, UberX should be 1st like it's always been. Always fixing something that's not broken smh"
"It works nice often. But it happened to me a few times when a nearby driver accepted the trip, then didn't move for a long time, no answers to messages or calls. For quite some trips we waited for 20mins+ without being canceled (when the expected pick up time was 2-3mins). I couldn't find any options to contact customer service for this matter when it was happening or after I had to cancel it eventually, all I could do is to waste all the time and wonder when i have to cancel a trip."
It's good
Wonderful thank you!
The app charged me more than the price that was stated.
Good
Fabulous! So efficient. And you save a ton of money. Uber are the business.
Uber service was excellent.. driver was very cooperative ...and he dropped us very safetly
Excellent
Slooooooooow app to start... slooooooooooow
Almost always exactly what I want and need.
Great for travelers
Where is the Uber Eats option?
Love Uber. Always get great service. A++++
"Is greatly appreciated and perfect, polite drivers"

Great
Fast and reliable... Thank you

This app is trash!!!🤬 If they don't take your money in your bank then it's them just cancelling rides. A driver of this app had a car accident with me and yet still they didn't do anything about it. Nonsense!
Excellent
Very convenient
Very nice opinion
Good
Nice app
Charging higher than usual. Their amount is always the the double of the ride. Definitely not going to use it anymore.
Rate hike after mentioning lower rate.paid Rs 470 at 7.30 pm and Rs 460 at 11.40 pm
Good experience
His very kind and thoughtful
Awesome
"Set pick up point, scroll map, pick up point remains where it was on the screen. A pretty fundamental bug in software that Is supposed to help you meet with drivers. If I could rate 0/5 I would. Near useless."
Forgot my bag when I got out. Tried calling the driver ( who has their phone infront of them the whole time ) no ansewr. Voicemail and not much help from the UI either. I don't think I'm getting my things back.
"Canceled the ride ,didn't get the money back."
This stupid app does not work. I can't even set up my account because it sends a code to my email but resets to the beginning of setup when I check my email. Worthless!
Always errors. Never managed to actually get a taxi
Quick pickup on a rainy night and good service!
"My ride was so amazing,the driver was friendly and very nead,the car was clean and smells nice,"
Driver was friendly and a safe driver. Uber also notified us when we were stopped for a few minutes to ensure everything was ok and we didn't need any assistance.
Mharram was a very nice driver. Very professional. Highly recommended.
Easy
Transportation
excellent
Good
"Great experience , helpfull and quick response 👍🏻"
The Help function is AI driven and does not allow user to describe other issues with the trip. I requested a ride and the driver started the trip about 10minutes before pick up. App help is useless if the user cannot describe the problem. I'm very disappointed by this.
Very nice
"Rips off drivers and the customer. Has done nothing about scam drivers that try to farm cancels, too."

Not proper working its always having technical issues not

"Hv been using Uber for so many years, but never faced such an appalling situation like today, where one cab driver named Samuilla of Park Circus outright rejected my request of turning the AC on and in turn started to abuse me aggressively while telling me to cancel the ride which I had boarded after waiting for over 10 mins. Really disappointed with Uber and its policy of choosing the driver for providing services to us. Will stop using Ubet services henceforth."
Good
Uber drivers provide efficient and very professional customer service.
Too personal. But good ride prices
Consistently better than the others.
It's not as much the apps fault as it is the system that empowers the drivers. The ability to cancel on you at anytime even after a long delay is terrible. I personally hate this app as a result
Reliable

Better price than rapido

They gave me 70% promotion 😂🥰
Pleasant driver safe driver. I appreciate him I am older and no longer drive so he was great.
Uber driver service is very bad Uber auto driver night demanding extra money & behaviour very rood.
My personal experience was very bad with uber and waiting time is tooooo long they should have to focus and not waste time for others
He was exceptional and very helpful.
They over charge. They won't let you cancel your Uber one and they will continue to take the payment for the uber one. Even if you deleted the app. Then when you contact them they are going to say they don't see the transaction for you to call your bank. Your bank will tell you they are lying because it shows they took. Uber is a rip off for real. Then I just took a ride for 11.66 and I was charged 12.78.
I was able to schedule ride day before; driver right on time & excellent drive to airport! I hope he is paid well & receives all of my custom tip🙂
Good
Awesome compare to Bolt services... Trusted with the reliable good vehicles...
Over a dollar a mile? No thanks.
best service
Long delay to find the ride
Pathetic Service
Suggesting drivers are nearby but they won't come. I'd give 0/5 of possible.
Good service
Mostly experience is very good but one thing that 1) driver not come form time. 2) helmet issue.. Not in good condition 3) driver said that cancel ride for your side after cancle customer paid extra cancellation charegs. 4) wait time show 2 minutes but driver come 10 minutes why if emergency than? Improve some points for best service

"It's become unusable now they've added an option to get a faster pickup for an additional fee. Unless you pay the extra fee, you don't get an Uber for ages. Typical company trying to squeeze more money out of customers unnecessarily. Will be switching to another taxi provider from now on."
"I would recommend uber anytime they fast and reliable, very happy and satisfy with thier service"
Too many recent glitches

Worst app I ever seen in my life reason that me and my friend book a ride it was auto that was abusive and harrassing both of us and my friend complaint to Uber customer service that take a strict action or we will take legal action they just locked my friend id
Amazing service with affordable pricing
Useless app drivers wont accept your ride if they dont think its worth it. Got stranded at 2am because nobody would accept the ride so i was forced to walk nearly 2 hours to get home
The final amount payable upon reaching the destination is significantly more than the one shown while booking. Why is that so?
Uber is the best service
"This app is absolutely the worst. Everytime I use it, nothing goes well. Either the taxi teleports everywhere, it randomly cancels, the taxi won't even be in the same town as me, the timer increases out of nowhere and at one point, one of the drivers literally stopped and went shopping while I'm out here waiting. I'd rather take a bus or any other type of transport instead because saying Uber is terrible is being generous. Don't use this app unless you enjoy having problems every day."
Got charged for a ride that was canceled not the first this has happened uber sucks big time no way to complain
Very bad service
Timely and great driver
Worst experience today. Driver took totally double than what shown before the trip. Waste app which I didn't like it. Kindly revert me back with my amount you have collected from.
just wait time are longer in some areas otherwise everything is seamless and quick
I booked auto in Uber app for my son to go to his tuition. When I have put the location in the map of the Uber. He took the auto to the another residential society I called him 23 times but he didn't pick up when I saw his location I called him then he pick it . The total fire was 248 rupees when I gave him 250 rupees when I asked for my 2 rupees back he said that why are you taking 2 rupees are you so poor. I have request to Uber that please to show some respect to their customers
Nice travel

You are overcharging this festive
I added rs 150 gift card for a trip and after the trip started (costing rs 143) my wallet balance is rs. 7. But when checking the current trip details..it says you need to pay cash. It's so confusing because then you have to wait all the way till the end of the trip for the driver to confirm the payment status. And while checking the wallet section it says that rs 150 was added and is valid till next year. So it means that there is no was to know if your gift card is being used or not.
Good Apps
Exhalent
Please remove the forced auto translate feature! It's crazy we are forced into it and there is no option to turn it off.
"without asking my concern, money has bwen deducted from my account that is 4 GBP. when i trued contacting customer support, another hectic process."

The worst taxi app I've ever used
"Pago Uber one, las tarifas todo el tiempo estan en alta demanda y cuando me acepta un conductor siempre esta a mas de 10 minutos sin importar en donde lo pida, es una basura este servicio, este año me cambio a Didi y no paguen Uber one, no vale la pena."
Helpful
Very fast and trip fair
"Very nice gentleman, God bless him and his family...."
Comfortable
Very nice behaviour of DRIVER and in time.Excellent experience.
Took long to pick up
It's amazing but most of my orders especially motorbikes were canceled by the drivers and left me frustrated
good experience.. polite driver
Takes long to find me an uber
Bhaiyya AC 2 pe karo
Very affordable 👌 top notch service
"Uno paga mucho más que en transporte público por cuestión de apuro. 15 minutos para conseguir un auto y otros 10 de espera para que llegue, AUN PAGANDO PRIORIDAD. La aplicación tiene bugs y actualiza más seguido que el diario. Los choferes bien, la aplicación deja que desear."
Awesome drivers
Good service
Debits money before securing a driver
While giving estimate please provide breakup too because drivers always demands entry fee seperately in cash which are also included in your cost.
Reliable
"Worst experience ever I had in my Uber travel experience. In the London city, I was waiting for almost 1hour to accept my ride request and none of the drivers accepted the ride. This is ridiculous at night why the drivers are so choosy on accepting the rides based on location. Hence I'm putting down my rating."
"Simple to use, easy to figure out for beginners but should make the prices more fair 8 out of 10."
Good service

Drivers non stop cancel in Brisbane get your people together Edit: 2 years later and uber is still worse then a 3rd world country on a Friday in Brisbane how have you done so badly?
App is life changing in all it's aspects
Very nice junryy
She was awesome and very friendly Very sweet lady.
"Refuses to allow me to login for some reason. Have used the web app without any problems, but now the actual app is not even letting me in! What's the point?"
"Years of using this app and it has always been fast to get a taxi, within like 4 mins TOPS but now they randomly added a pay more and get a taxi faster option and now I have waited over 20-30 minutes for a taxi? Yeah that seems legitimate and not like a money grabbing scam at all, it's already way more expensive than any other taxi firm but this is just disgusting."
We received a nice and clean vehicle. Driver drove well and very friendly and pleasant.

"Terrible service from Adelaide Airport, taxi prices are 6 times the normal fares. Shifted to using taxis. The cancellations from drivers are immense and terrific."
I was charged a cancellation fee when I wasn't able to edit the route. That's not fair. Plus I was charged more than the 2 rides I actually took. That's a shady business practice. I'm not compensating the driver if the ride is cancelled. That's your job!
Unnecessary exceeded fair charges . Their donot cancels the ride n they charges us more for cancelling the ride. Their riders donot come on time
Excellent 👍
Good aap for instant go any where
"No customer support. Paid trip amount to Driver Directly, as he asked for the payment through cash. Still showing pending in App and unable to book any ride."
Good service but few drivers use uber for getting easy customers through UBER . They try to cancel trip to get full payment.They must recognised by UBER itself. This type of drivers have no rights to do this type of act. Rating is 5 for UBER service but rating for such type of drivers is 2. They are damaging the reputation of UBER services. Especially in evening most of the drivers ask the money and if it is less they cancel the trip. It getting worse and I also thinking to ....
Good service

Most worst app for cab booking. The booking took 30 minutes to book a cab. After 20 minutes I left looking for the cab and put the app in background and after 15 minutes I am getting a message the partner has arrived and charged me for that.

"I booked my ride for the 1st time with this app and fare was showing 90 rupees, when I reach the destination the driver asked me for 140 rupees. It was not driver's fault, he showed me his phone that in his phone he was showing 140 for the same ride. Kindly solve this type of issues in your app as it creates discripency.. worst experience even in 1st ride using this app.."
Selsmen
Nice
There is now no way to actually contact uber if you have a problem. It's all AI and chat bots. There was no way to report or talk to someone about my issue. I had a scheduled pick up for this morning but the driver was assigned to a different trip and I was never contacted and another driver was not assigned. I've used uber a decent amount over the years. Probably switching to Lyft now.
Drivers are very humble..... And excellent service
Please update your map or what ever is the navigation app or tool you have. I have to wait for too long and cancel several rides because your navigation map pointing the driver in wrong direction and road closures.
Very useful application!
High quality services at reasonable prices.
Very worst app ... Always cancel the ride after booking.

"Uber is becoming the scam of the century. Reserved a ride 6 wks ago 4 miles to the ATL airport for 16.46. 2 hrs B4 my scheduled PU my card which has never been a problem and has more than enough money on it was Miraculously DECLINED. After being hung up on 2x by some jackass who was clearly at home because, I heard his kid in the background, I was finally able 2 speak 2 a less jackass who insisted on booking me for the same trip @ 22.42 but I'm looking now and was charged 25.46. Bunch of BS."

"Ok Uber, I have no outstanding balances. My app is up to date. Always been a 5 start customer. I keep getting error detected when I request a ride. This is extremely annoying when I'm booking it for a plane trip. This has happened many times throughout the years."

Fantastic

Professionalism on Point.... Well done!
company need to work on their drivers....they are doing manipulation while customer are booking there driver...when the price is ok for XYZ ride drivers are not pick the ride....but if customers are cancel the ride and book instant for same ride location suddenly drivers pick the ride.....but there's about 100-120 price difference between the last and current ride....this is daily routine of drivers.....and uber don't take any action on their drivers.......worst drivers experience all the time.

why most of bike drivers demands extra money even after high price on uber ??

Worst app It will not take source location precisely if you are booking for others No wonder how this app tested and got deployed in Play Store Such a pathetic app
"Uber drivers keep ignoring my trip making me wait 20 minutes for a confirmed ride, plus I booked an Uber trip the other time and canceled the trip. I had to pay a cancelation fee for R10 which I didn't mind, but the rest of my money didn't come back."
I am using oppo find x8 with Android 15. In my device uber driver app not is working. Giving notification as you may need to use a different device or update the app Plz help resolve this app issue for Android 15 divce

Ur Uber taxi is fake.. Whenever we tried till now we have not got the taxi.. And then we have to waste time waiting for it.. After taking the ride they don't come to the pick up locations..
The worst app I have ever used ... Don't show where driver is even change the fare in fraction of second.. waiting time tooo long .... And when driver is to long and we have change our mode of transport then also we have to pay them The worst app
very disappointed. They cheat with me. When I book a car fare shows Rs. 449 but when I reached my destination then fare shows 581. After reaching my destination I paid extra 131 rupees. Fully cheater
Very very nice they always come on time and find drivers very easy in less time but there's only one problem that occurs sometimes that fair price becomes very high as compared to other apps pls work on it otherwise this is the best
My fast trip nice
Nice app
Great
Needs to work on location accuracy
This app is getting worst day by day. Locking genuine account without any reason.
"I have always had a very pleasant experience with Uber as compared to other moto apps. Whether its auto, cabs, suvs or uber package, this has been my preferred transport. They often give me diacounts and fares are far lesser than other app rides."

"Uber Performance is good. Only some of Uber drivers do not agree to go after acceptance,they ask addtl amnt. Later they do not cancel and forced the customer to cancel. In that case customer no option to put the note with uber for drivers behaviour. Request to look into this matter...it is in general and facing several times in bhubaneswar, odisha."

Always driver says they show extra amount aap . Very bad
"The service is top notch, but you people really need to tell you drivers what amount they should be asking for, like when they finish the ride there's an amount which is shown in our app too, and then they ask for the amount that is shown later on after finishing the ride, which I guess if their profit amount. You need to change that."
"Uber in India has no standard, especially when it comes to auto booking. They accept and cancel the bookings more faster than the speed of light. They have no sense and they understand no emergency of the passengers. Cancelling my 4 rides after accepting the bookings uber expects me to rate them!!! I would rather walk than taking an uber."
I use it sometimes and so far I like it 💗💗

I am using uber daily but yesterday your driver did not call me and cancelled the ride from their side but i had paid cancellation charges. I was already late at that time. so i booked rapido. I thought rapido driver is far better than you guyz

"Pathetic service, during time of booking lot of cans , once you select cab type and destination, waiting time and cab availability gone sucks. Longer than expected and wastes 30 min in search of cab.They don't know how to improve service only wasting time of customer. Better to switch to different app."
"The app is great and all but whenever I try and request a ride, it always tells me there's something wrong with my connection and the app... I just installed it and there's nothing wrong with my connection. I don't understand why it does not want me to request. And if it does it ends up telling me it's out of the drivers boundaries and it's probably just 10 minutes away as I know it's not out of boundaries coz Ive went further then 10 minutes. I kindly don't recommend using Uber, unless its fix"
For me personally Uber is convenient and safe however the only problem I'm facing is that the fare goes up while you in the Uber which doesn't work because what if I only have enough cash as the amount shown when I requested

Why are there not a -star because uber deserves a -5 star rating in sylacauga alabama. It useless here waisted space. They just do not have drivers..... and I do not kn8w why.......
Uber sucks now. they don't hire good workers who care about their rides but hire ones who don't cancel rides so that they can price gouge.
👍🏻
The two factor authentication takes two devices. The app crashes if you leave the screen to read the temporary pin and you start all over again in an endless loop

Driver made me walk to pick location and he cancelled the trip... Very bad service from Uber. After that I book cab from Ola and their driver so kind.
Good experience
"It's terrible, no longer reliable at all, waste of time"
Best ride
It's the worse app and by day by day it become more worse than I think. It takes much time to finding a driver and when I finally found one the driver cancel the trip. I really don't want to give them a single star but I have no option.
"This whole company is sham. Overcharged me over a scooter. I have reached out twice, no response from support. I was charged $23 for riding a scooter for less than 25 mins. That is very overpriced. Yall will not be getting that $23. I'm contacting my bank to dispute the charges and have uber blocked from attempting to take that ridiculous payment amount."
The app is not working properly making so many updates but still not working very bad experience kindly see to the glitch problem and solve it uber 😀

They keep updating the app and auto update never works...

Very good service
Easy and reliable
"Extremely bloated app. Far too many updates. Unlike Lyft, still cannot send a text message to driver."
"Drivers accepts the ride and cancel on their own. Often gets late for work.... Don't waste your time waiting for Uber. Better use Rapido. Yes, the price will be a little higher than Uber but still the drivers will arrive on time without canceling the ride. #UBER DO SOMETHING"
Good
"Uber is great , convenient,and a life saver . I've been in a pinch a few times and Uber has my back , at this point I don't know what id do without it!!!!"
Nice 👍🏻
Value for money
Convient to use
"Love this app, half the drivers speak little to no English, don't follow the gps and make wrong turns, the app says 5 minute pick-up for 30 bucks then gives you someone a half hour away, and if it's closer the driver will sit still for 10 minutes before canceling and you have to get a new driver anyways so wasted time"

"It was 1 of the best in the market in providing quality of service. Now, it has the worst service ever. You cannot find easily how to talk to customer care service, their mail support is not available now, their call support is also not available and in chat (if you find that option) they cannot help because of their updated Uber policies. All the best for the company & the users!"
I wish you got a ride immediately instead of having to wait 2 or 3 hours sometimes
Good
So cool
"PREDATORY. Used Uber, and they somehow made me sign up for One. No way to contact support if you are a rider or use another service. Perhaps they were hoping I wouldn't notice? Don't save your payment info on the app. Or better yet, don't use an app that is sneaky and predatory. The only way to contact customer service is through email. Edit: So they respond once, saying they canceled my membership. I had already canceled to get my card off the app . Charge back plus BBB and ftc complaint filed."
Fast and good 👍👍
It's great

uber changed price from original 🤬
Listen for ten yrs.great artist.
not paying the driver fairly. I was charged way more than the driver received. I'd rather book through a local company than through Uber.
Too expensive

"Parabéns Uber! Em vez de melhorar seus serviços para ficar mais competitivo, vocês obrigam os usuários a pagar taxas adicionais e, caso eles se recusem, vocês punem eles com uma qualidade de serviço horrível e fazendo elas perderem tempo até não terem outra opção além de pagar. Parabéns! Continuem assim!! A propósito... Fiz esse review enquanto me sacaneavam, me fazendo esperar mais de 30 min por uma corrida."
He was great
fast And easy to use
Too expensive And bad drivers
Terrible app without customer service
Gee there seems to be a LOT of 'surge pricing' going on... Greedy scamming bastards
"El peor servicio, tarifas muy altas y conductores descorteses, servicio al cliente da risa y esperar mas de 15 minutos aun sin tráfico cuando la aplicación dice que son 6, aunque pagues por uber one no hay diferencia del servicio, no vale la pena. Y uber eats, de lo peor que me ha tocado..."
Good experience
شركه زباله تستاهل تقيم اقل من ١ عشان السواقين الي اقل من المستوي الي فيها اتمني تتقفل في مصر عشان نرفع من مستوي الخدمه
"The Uber app is incredibly convenient and reliable! It’s easy to use, with a seamless interface that makes booking a ride quick and hassle-free. I love how I can track my driver in real-time and get an accurate ETA. The payment process is straightforward, and having fare estimates upfront is a huge plus. The drivers are generally professional and friendly, and the availability of different ride options is great for any budget or occasion. Uber has made getting around so much easier."
Good service

Dec.4 booked a ride to celebration but drive did nit come in 2hrs waiting ..but they used my card for 28.74
Not safe
Thank You Daniel.
"Thanks Uber for the kindness of your service in lille France when we were left behind by our coach, On a way day for from Kent England. Xx my gratitude for the courtesy of your driver."
Uber eats and Uber drivers are 👌🏽
Everything was about timing
Wonderful 😊👍!
Great app
I use it often. It's very useful.😊
Easy and accessible
Always use uber for a fast reliable ride
"Good trip with kelvin, so calm no disturbance"
Really safe and good
Gud service
"Excellent service, thanks"
"We had a great driver. Left my phone in his car, he delivered it to me."
"I recommend anyone new trying to sign up, don't. The code I got is incorrect."
"AVOID AT ALL COSTTheir driver passed me. Passed the person they were paid to pick up. I watched him drive by, no idea where he was going, but it clearly wasn't to me. I watched both the driver and his ""location"" on my Uber app, go past my pick up point. I immediately cancelled and used a different more reliable ride share. Uber charged me $5, for cancelling the trip that I clearly wasn't going to get. Look at their stock price value!! It's decreasing daily because this company is on its way out"
GREAT!!
Always very prompt. Never keep you waiting!
Fast and reliable.
"VERY UNHAPPY Driving part prob works fine. It takes too long to set up. Then when I TRIED, NOT SUCCEEDED to delete my information it gave me the run-around and I CAN'T DELETE MY INFORMATION. I can delete the app but it still has my information."
"The service seems fine, yet it freezes up to the point of absurdity halfway from point A to point B during a couple of trips."
I see uber moto saver on other devices but not mine
👍
"First time in Poland, glad we had Uber."
"I'm starting to get ****** off with their rating system. I go out of my way every time to be pleasant and respectful to their drivers not once have i had any issues and yet my score drops, I even tip when i can. Either Uber is doing it or their drivers are doing it for the fun of it eitherway I'm taking my money to another company where it'll be more appreciated."
It's always provide nice experience
My UBER's 1st Ride is a Good start!
Enshittification at its finest.

For the most part the drivers make you feel safe and are amicable.

"Worst payment experience on any app I have used so far. Still unable to add that UK train tickets purchased in-app to the Google Wallet directly. Also, with Uber eats and train / flight ticket options added, the app is too cluttered and confusing to use. Train tickets QR codes cannot be accessed from the Uber app either. (Have to use the PDF received via email only)"

I just had such a wonderful driver. She made my day!!
Auto driver's and taxi drivers ask extra money. If we are not accepting they tell us to cancel ride
Very good service
Fast and useful
They have gotten worse will pay you $8.00 for a 45 minute ride
Well done
I trust and prefer Uber for all my rides 🙌
since I opt for uber one . drivers don't pick me up .food delivery is even worse .will have to stop subscription:(
Thanks for ride
Good experience good service.

"Please let me turn off auto translations in the messages, I don't need them, they're kind of annoying. Or at least, let me change the language within the apps. Also, let us report drivers who cancel trips because we're not paying with cash."
Nice uper
Very best appp seriously loving theee app fare
The Uber app is still not as user friendly as it should be after all these years. I often need to request a ride more than once before the app accepts my request
High prices
Good and very smooth trip.

Disgusting and pathetic app uber people are fraud and their drivers as well you guys don't even provide proper customer care number shame on uber. If this reaches you I need a call back urgently.
Good
Last driver I had made sure I was at the right hospital before he drove off because I had a broken leg so I tipped him 12 bucks.
"Terrible service, I have Uber one and yet I can never find a taxi. They make you wait untill your eventually give up and buy priority even as an Uber member!"
Very smooth and affordable price.

"In my town I wait for 10 min to connect to a driver, than another 3-5min for the driver to accept it and after this sometimes the driver cancels the ride after accepting it. They only have like 2-3 cars availeble at one time. Too small of a fleet in this area. Unusable. At this exact moment while i write this review i am on hold for 12min. No driver accepted my ride"
Always works like it should ..
Very disappointed canceled a ride because was taking long to find a driver said I was not charged for it but still took the money off my card and put hold on it still has hold on it and made it where I couldn't request a ride cause money didn't go back on my card
"This is not good at all, I talked for two minutes and tried a lot but still he did not come, my movie also came out and got missed"
Very bad service
Cheap relyable service👍
Love it
Uber is good but There are some issues available when it's comes to riding with Uber. Sometimes it is very good and working very fine. but some times there are issues such like processes are not working properly and the options are bit unfair when selecting or changing things. If you like further discussion I am available. I have several suggestions as well to improve the Uber customer satisfaction. Thank you.
"Excellent service, pick ups on time, vehicles spotlessly clean and drivers who are well spoken, well mannered and not over- bearing. Thankyou."
"This Uber Rides App stinks & sucks! Why U may ask?? I used 2 C d price b4 I ride, I could determine how much 2 spend, so I could budget my money, since the update, now I can't! At least w/a restaurant U can still C d price tag 4 food! Another corrupt thing that Uber has done to both the Driver, & d rider! I'm tired of d bull-🤬! It's time some1 does something about this! It used to be a pleasure 2 ride Uber when it was affordable! It's no longer worth it! It's cheaper w/Lyft!🤔🙄🫣🤫"

Horrible had so many issues with drivers being rude and canceling rides especially when ordering a ride for my 79 yr old mother they jus left her there because she had a walker so ridiculous if u can bring people with walkers don't drive and don't be rude and cold about it
good service
Worst app ever wasting my time to find ride i will never use this app again
👍
Would not recommend using Uber As an update I gave to them a safety concern regarding one of their drivers and they just ignored me. So for that reason decided to no longer be a customer of Uber anymore.
"Very poor, I had already paid to driver, still app is asking me pay again in app. Poor customer very difficult to even reacg and no resolution no response nothing.. Tried to connect on social media.. Same no response.. Malpractices.. To make me payment twice for same ride."
"Horrible experience! Scamming money out of customers by showing high fare! Showed a difference of approx Rs.1000 when I booked the cab and when it cab dropped me off. Raised complaint, the difference was paid back to wallet! Why? To get scammed again and use my extra Rs.1000 on uber only? Getting a confirmed order of Rs.1000 again? Raised issue again, They said I will receive refund through payment link to redeem amount in 7 days, it's been 7 days, no amount refunded to my source account!"
Uber is very convenient

Cannot cancel subscription for Uber One without contacting support after it was renewed? That's a joke. Should be illegal.

This was my first ever ride. I waited only for 2 minutes. The driver's nature was friendly and cooperative. I enjoyed the ride.
Can't find drivers
They're alright. They could work on their map system. They are pretty good at vetting drivers for the most part.

Scammed for £4.81 robbing bastards
Uber is a scam I just tried to get an Uber three blocks which says 5 minutes in GPS but Uber is LYING!! saying it's 13 minutes I'm still trying to figure out how is that so
"Worse app and service ever, deceiving"
prompt and courteous .
"""I really like the Uber app. I've booked cabs many times and often found that the fare price increased significantly upon reaching the destination. However, whenever I complained about it, I got my money refunded immediately ""."
Best driver
Better than other apps
wery wery best service. ...👌👌👌👌
Take too long time
Reliable rides
It is very difficult to make contact regarding a driver or an issue. Can't you make this app easier to navigate with a subtitle or such so one can tap & it gives a direct area to write a problem to you instead of tapping on one area then open that area up and tap on another and so forth just to get to the help one needs. Please make your app senior friendly! I depend on you for rides. Thank you.
Very good service
"Exceptional driver, excellent service"

"Shittest app available. They connect me with drivers miles from me and they dont even actually arrive but they cancel after making me wait 20 minutes. All the vehicles are uncomfortable. None of the drivers drive well. If i instruct them to go this way, they go that way miles off where i need to be. And guess what? Driving further away just causes the bill to increase. Every single time it's more when paying than when it shows at the beginning. And the app is extremely laggy"
Good experience with uber driver
"My driver picked me up, and dropped me at less than 1 km saying he won't accept online payment to Uber Uber, he himself toldme he didn't want online payment as hos uber account was jn negative. I pay all my rides online, for such a driver ubercharged me Rs 60. What for? Dont you check where he droped me? Dont you check who cancelled? Why should i pay for no mistake of mine There's no way one can contact customer care. Theres no way one can raise a complaint"
قمه الاحترام
I took my ride for rs 105 but driver took 165 rs for it and I complaint about this thing but no one is responding to my concern I want my money back that was worst experience
Good experience
You pay for priority and it still takes a long time. The markup on food is ridiculous. Do your best to pickup instead of using Uber.
very comfortable
Good
"I appreciate the timeliness of the drivers, the fact that 98% are clean, newer cars with courteous drivers. Most are aware of their surroundings and willing to chitchat if they are engaged in a conversation. 98% of Uber drivers will follow your directions or suggestions of how to reach your destination. Overall I'm very pleased & satisfied with Uber service."
Good
They always charging my account twice. It's annoying
Awesome ride and driver was very good
Exceptionally good 👍👍👍👍👍
Waste app it is showing long route even for short distance also and price is becoming high because of that. It should have option to select route so that price become dynamic based on distance. Literally pissed off

I can't give u staring because last ride your driver drunk and abuse language with my family He take charges more otherwise can't stop car Your drivers so bad so poor and cheap family I can't use your this App and suggest my all friends and family This app and drivers are so cheap. This staring use only for post otherwise I can't use Star they are my black day
Awesome experience till now looking forward also the same ...
"Longtime uber user and I've usually had no problems, but a recent ride I had soured my mood towards uber. I booked a ride a day in advance and the price was $21, but I ended up being charged $36 after the ride the next day. Straight up robbed $15 with no refund. Also had an issue where I booked a ride and had 3 drivers cancel on me and had to place a ride AGAIN at a higher price. Makes me reconsider not wanting to use uber if this happens again."

Worst app. showing different amount to passenger and driver Drivers are canceling the ride due to this and we have to pay the cancelation fee if we don't tell them the price initially they argue at the end of ride and demand extra money. don't use this app ever..
Doesn't allow you to delete my account. Gives bad request errors.
Best for a ride
It's nice I love the way they behave

"I'll never use Uber again I've been ripped off three times now because of technical issues and there's no support number for riders, only drivers. They charge me 45$ for a 15 minute ride and when they get the drop off address wrong, I can't change the destination I have to cancel and reserve a new ride, just to get charged 25 bucks because it was 55 minutes until pick up. This app is a major rip off and there's no customer support whatsoever. They're only worried about making their billions. 😡"
Bad payment charger costly h

"I am regularly using this app since many years. Very prompt, no hidden charges, good drivers and better Service proding app. Would advise all to use it."

Really frustrating now as it takes ages for confirming a ride. And once confirmed it gets canceled.
Driver denies for pick and drop option. And cancel the bookings it always affects on passengers.

UBER LOVES STEALING MONEY FROM PEOPLE
Horrible experience. Got stranded. I kept getting driver info (we got it about 7-8 times and we tried on 3 different devices with the same results) and then trip got cancelled each time. No reason given. We wasted almost an hour as we kept struggling to book a trip. This app used to be really good. It has become absolutely unreliable now. There is no mechanism where we can give feedback about this trip as it shows as cancelled. Please work on improving it asap!!
"fast, reliable and comfortable"

So far so good No bad experience with drivers So far but let's see how far
Why the F are you forcing customer to pay using their card. Why can't they pay cash if they want to? Why do you take people's IDs and card information and then not allow them to pay cash. Why verify them if in the end you will say they can't pay cash.

Worst ride booking app ever. It's better to book from apps like Rapido or Ola than here. I have already lost more than Rs.100 here due to the indifferent attitude by Uber support team.
Nice aap
Good right 👍
"I have been using Uber for nearly one and a half year , today is the worst trip I have ever had, the driver is too rude, please verify the driver backgrounds and also please improve your payment methods it would be helpful for both the drivers and the passengers"

"Good app, best drivers"
I am using this as a platform to provide feedback to uber. I booked a premium cab but instead was sent an uber go. I was charged the amount that was shown for premium in the beginning. It is even more pathetic that they don't even have an option for raising this issue in their menu options.

Nice ride with You
okay I thought for starters Uber has waiting time costs so why the anymosity by drivers when they have to wait a minute or two. secondly some locations are not picked up by the app and then when you tell the driver you picked the closest to you it becomes an issue.
Very good experience
Worst management ever show less price while booking but then driver shows extra payment also then the price in the app also changes according to driver. Rapido charges more fare but no problem like these happens there.
App constantly gives me drivers that are further away has another job and is often slower than public transportation completely unacceptable
"Please get hold of drivers ... Unprofessional behaviour, rude tone,extra payment and unnecessary calling and on top of that wrong vehicle number..it can't get worst than this I suppose!"
Love whoever invented Uber and Uber eats very convenient
The latest update of one pass is more troubling than helpfull. They only book top rated drivers under it and it's taking minimum 15 min to get any ride confirmed. Plus the drivers are usually more than 8min away. This was supposed to be helpful. Please don't buy Uber one pass.
Not having your own transportation makes it hard to get anywhere so thanks for Uber to be there for us awesome 👍
It used to be my go to app but now it is near to useless because no one accepts the request.
car was super. Driver also proper and well behaved. clean and well maintained vehicle. enjoyed.
safe ans perfect
"Depending on the network connectivity and coverage, it might or might not work! Can be unreliable during any circumstance. Caveat Emptor! Update 18-apr-24: The dynamic pricing is pathetically skewed so no drivers want to accept low fare rides for a 30 km distance in the Navi Mumbai area, the app support function is HORRIBLE!!!Update05-DEC-24: Finding an uber is the worst experience now for us, with drivers either cancelling or asking if we can pay them in cash."
Best app but The amount changes when you book a ride
Excellent
"Uber standards for drivers has dropped significantly over the years. I have gotten some very terrible drivers recently. They also keep jacking up the prices seemingly at random. There are four Uber drivers in my immediate area (more than normal) and what is normally a $12 ride got jacked up to $30 out of nowhere. Lyft was 11$ at the same time, so I will be switching, as I use this to commute to work and can't afford the cost of Uber anymore."
Please start uber bike badlapur to thane location.

"Third class , rude driver today by the name Mulue. My wife and 4 yo son was scared. I wish I was there to have a conversation with him. Reported him on the Uber as well."
"When you schedule a ride in advance, they charge you, then cancel the ride and then charge your a se time for a higher price. Do not trust scheduling in advance. First time trying Uber. After this experience, I recommend going with other ride shares."

"Damn shame they drove all of the reliable taxi services out of business. Now if there's inclimate weather you're screwed because the drivers drive when they want and take the rides they want, instead of the structured schedule of a local business."
Dont use this app y because mere saath bohot bada dhoka hua aur froud hua kyu k book karte samaye mujhe 149 dikhaya aur drop k time pe 250 pucha drivar aur hum ladies ko bohot battamizi se pesh aya aur ye app se mujhe security bhi nahi thi ki mai customer care ko callkarne k liye so mujhe bohot problem hui aur wo mujhe bohot battamizi kara ye ek security pr nahi hai uber so b carefully gys.

Too much traffic but ride was comfortable
"The worst cab app , i booked bike and he took 15 min and the called me and said that my bike is broked , so please cancel. Then i booked an other ride he stood at same location for 10 min and didn't even picked my call up . I missed my very important meeting. I am not happy and i will never install thes app ever again. The worst cab app , i booked bike and he took 15 min and the called me and said that my bike is broked , so please cancel. Then i booked an other ride he stood at same location"

Good service
"We were waiting by the KZ7 opposite the bar Rosie's, with our elderly mother, to have been asked to walk 140 to 150 meters, to meet up with Uber drivers!!! I am paying to be picked up, NOT TO BE ORDERED TO WALK, so two Indian Uber drivers cancelled 2 times before a ( none indian) gentlemen picked us up where we were waiting ( I had ordered a comfort Uber). Disgusting behaviour, this is not a good way to make a name for your selfs."
Every time is good for passenger
Good service
nice app b ride
"On ""plan your ride"" screen the scroll doesn't works to use ""the pin"" to select a place on the map, only a fix number of travel history is shown. Neither can delete travel history to ""the pin"" appear on screen has last option. - Samsung Galaxy S10 lite, android 13, one ui 5.1 JC. Fix the scroll, thanks!!"
So bakvas service all Time no one response quickly
Very friendly service thankyou
Worst app
Very good UBER APP
Quick and easy to use.
"First 4 cars offered unable to book, only when taking the "" luxury option "" at extra cost did booking go through. Bad practice and customer service"
Nice app
"They are saying that service is super fast and you will get your ride within 10 minute but I waited about 40 minutes again and again for ride, but each time after completing the scanning process , it's show that no is available right now at morning time in between 5:00 am to 6:00 am. Wrost app ever I've used."
"absolute trash,very long waiting time if I had the option to give zero stars I would."
This app is not good waitting too much time
"Easy to use, very helpful"
I really like Uber they go out of there way to get a ride I have no complaints I intend to keep them for my rides.thanks uber.

Expectations were met

Really easy and safe to travel around the world.

Brilliant service So helpful and reliable I'm very happy with Uber
Terrible customer service. They charge when the restaurant doesn't have your items. Uninstall and use doordash
Uber works for me when I need it. Overall I feel safe with Uber drivers. Worth the $$
Charged me twice for two trips. And bot were done on next morning. And after contacted help they tell that they only charged once but they charged 348 first then again 260 for return ride. Then again 348 and again 260. So i recieve for emails and the same amount deducted from my accout twice. Still they say they only charged once. And this happend to me two days in a row. I only add ascreen shot of a one day incident emails.
They take more money than they should
Bahut acha
"The customer service for billing on business trips is AWFUL. They applied a credit that I had, even though I had unchecked it for use, and ended up causing a major issue with billing on my expense report that resulted in a huge issue with my expense report and the accounting department where I work. I have asked for resolution over, and over, and over again, and they are ignoring me. I don't trust Uber at all!!!"
Great and Better than Ola always
Great ride!!😊
Awkward & extremely regimented. Choices incomplete and don't indicate problem.
"What is the point of paying for uber comfort if the drivers are not going to respect the preferences of the user? And when asking to, they just answer, "" I can end the drive if you dont like it""."
"30 November ko sonipat ke liye Uber li thi Jo address dala Tha use pahle utarna pada or koi Traffic bhi, nahi, tha time se pehle hi Aye phir bhi uber ne extra charge ki. Mene driver ko kaha Ki main to destinations, pehale utar Rahi hu to jitna pahle dikha raha tha us se jada kese le sakta hai to wo bola ye to Uber hi dikha raha h me isme kuch nahi Kar sakta Very disappointing.seedha seedha loot macha Rakhi hai pahle bhi Kai bar esa hua h tab mujhe laga Traffic ki wajah se late hua hoga isiliye"
Hard time processing my credit card!
Nice
Solid
"Arranging the ride was super easy, and the driver arrived right on time. The car was clean, the driver professional and courteous, and the trip was absolutely effortless. This was my first time using Uber, and had an excellent experience!"
Helpful app
Very nice service
Nice.
The driver came fast to pick me up.
Uber is very convenient and affordable.
Driver I had was friendly funny n.very helpful carried my heavy bag to door n I'd left fone in his car which I was unaware off so he came out and gave to me anyone who has this driver be lucky as he's lovely and treats you with respect x😊
Very Good
Help - navigation sucks and doesn't yield results. You should provide better customer support mechanism
Surge pricing should be illegal. I am not paying quadruple what my ride is worth.

Dec2024 1. Get rid of the ads while I am enroute. 2. Improve the driver location accuracy. Terrible everyday this week. Late 2022 post govt lockdowns and lawless restrictions: the app and service is good. Early 2022 Last time I tried Uber a mask was required and some ridiculous msg was the first thing displayed when opening the app. Dropped rating due to their nonsense.
"No customer support at all! beware of their UberOne (subscription), unsubscribe button is well-hidden in the app!"
Nothing to complain about
Good trip and safety
Best app for travelling
"Worst experience, first of all the driver came 15 mins late and then we came to know the other cab came to take and then got scammed by them."

"Drivers are horrible, they coordinate locally to inflate the prices of rides, up to 30 dollars for a short ride even in cheaper areas. Absolutely stay away from this app, their support is also bad. Canceling my membership asap"
A very good service and safe travelling from Mhlolo Frenklin
The drivers keep changing even though the original price ($13.45 or something) and the time (15) were fine. STOP CHANGING THE DRIVER WHEN THE PRICE AND TIME ARE FINE. Stop changing the drivers all the time.
"Hiked Fees for rides when stranded or the ttc isn't working are criminal. $169 to get from bloor and yonge to finch and Don mills is insanity. The delivery guys often can't find locations, and so many uber drivers cancel their rides last minute for bigger fairs after you've been waiting 10 minutes. Go back to the days when the consumer was the priority not strictly the profit."
Awesome ride
So far my experience with Uber has been awesome
I didn't know that Uber is safest transport anytime..... Well done keep it up . End even they're cars are clean ..... Thank you
Great 👍
It's fast and reliable
One Jeremiah Enu was supposed to deliver an order to a someone I ordered the ride but he never delivered and he didn't call I called him when the person didn't get the item he told me he left and he doesn't know when he would return the item this is a very bad experience like I don't understand it been more than an hour his plate number is FST569QP a motor bike how could he take it to lekki from Victoria Island and he never even called pls I need help urgently
Easy
Uberrific!
Meet the coolest people cab drivers suck Uber drivers are awesome
Great as always
Good 💯
"Safety rules are going downhill. Drivers are constantly on their phones during rides. Non-stop chatting. It is distracting, risky, and extremely annoying to the person who has paid for a car service. Even taxi drivers are courteous enough not to do that. The app offers no good way to handle such complaints discreetly."
Reliable and excellent value
Nice
Keep it up uber good service
Happy journey

"Absolute scam of an app, they abuse the ""fares are slightly (or greatly) increased due to high demand"" even though there is 0 demand, intentionally raising the prices to 5x the normal price mean while they give their drivers NOTHING in comparison to the $50 charge for a 10 minute ride which normal is about $15 MAX. Fed up with this cash grab bs."
I forgot my phone in the car
Nice application
Ok
"Best ride service, nice drivers."
They charged me double the price for a ride without me accepting any extra fee and they didn't even have an agent for support. All I could do was look at the frequently asked questions. Double the price of an already expensive ride is not a joke.
Gregory was really personable. His car was very clean and smelled incredible 😊
Very nice
Jason was great. Even had a step up stool for my 80+yo mother
takes too long to confirm driver plus always wanting soo many things....like I mean cant it be quicker nje
"Service is good..but nowadays drivers are doing too much wrong. If u will book a ride & fixed your payment drivers will change their route, they will take unnecessary long route for your destination and will charge high. In that case u have to pay unnecessary extra money .Higher authority please look after this matter. Just for this dishonest reason I have left Ola service."
Absolutely wonderful & safe.
Someone jumped in into the Uber I ordered and started riding. I cancelled since I wasn't in the car and got another Uber PICKED UP FROM THE EXACT SAME LOCATION. Uber charged me for both "rides" even though the other car still had the passenger. Apparently I can be in two cars at once according to Uber. Support was useless. Now I'm going to have to charge back BOTH rides so we're even.
"It's becoming the worst app ever. While booking I got less amount with 50% valid coupon. But once after the ride is getting completed, the amount is getting changed in driver's app as thrice the amount before booking and they are demanding for more amount. Had really the worst experience in this App."
"Horrible customer support. They charge you for a service they fail to deliver, they refuse to refund you and they just repeat the same things unable to give a valid explanation."
I used the app when on vacation. I met every single driver at the designated spot at the designated time. I tipped every single driver. Some toxic driver gave me a bad rating for the sole purpose of being toxic and having nothing to do with my conduct. If the system is based on dishonesty and a lack of transparency then the system means nothing.
Nice
Cannot Update The payment method to UPI!! Unable to update the payment method at all except for cash! No resolution provided nor any way to contact the support team
The one main complaint I have with this app is the GPS is off not by a lot but the driver is one side of the street and I'm on the other. It's not always but sometimes. The GPS gives the driver weird direction. Like I thought we would be going this way but goes the other way. Like turning up the street but go back to the same street we left? I give it four stars. But overall the app is good.
I've had great service and on time ❤️
Good
Good timing good behavior
"I had a great driver Miss Patrice was nice patient, & conversed with me the whole ride I greatly appreciate her that is what great customer service is all about😁🫶🏿"
"ladrones, me tocó un conductor que no se sabía la ruta y un viaje que me costó 4.500 termino costando 18.000 sabiendo que la culpa la tenía el conductor por no llevar el soporte para el celular en la moto, realizó el reporte en uber y encima le dan la razón al conductor."
"Uber was great, now it's almost impossible to find a ride. You have to wait for like 10 minutes just for the driver cancel your ride and you start all over again. I didn't find a way to tell Uber about this issue, there is no place in the app that we can communicate this frustrating experience. I'm searching for other apps to see if they are better. At least let's us give the driver 1 star for cancelling the ride 500 meters away."

"Wow, I hadn't used Uber app for weeks and in the meantime I had bought a new phone and didn't have the app on yet on the new phone. Just now, went to add the app to new phone and it updated and the app took everything from the old phone onto the new phone and quick quick I booked my Uber ride just like that. Great system"
Great...
very good
Good job 👍⭐⭐
"Πρέπει να εκσυγχρονιστείτε. Σε πολλά rides, οι οδηγοί ακυρωναν. Λίγοι από αυτούς νωρίς, οι περισσότεροι τελευταία στιγμή. Οπότε η αναμονή αυξανόταν. Κάποιες φορές γινόταν και με 3 ή 4 οδηγούς σερί. Οπότε η ας πούμε αρχική αναμονή των 5 λεπτών, έφτανε να γίνεται μισή ώρα και βάλε. Επίσης, 8 στους 10 οδηγούς (τουλάχιστον στα rides τα δικά μας) ήταν 60+ ετών. Ο πιο πρόσφατος 70+. Εδώ δυσκολεύομαι ενίοτε εγώ να καταλάβω πως δουλεύει η εφαρμογή σας. Εκείνος; Έχω κι άλλα να πω αλλά δεν χωράει."
There's now full screen ads instead of showing information about the trip. Spam notifications

"Uber is the best. Your drivers are so nice. Your cars so clean and smell very fresh. The rides are very good,no speeding and very careful drivers. I couldn't ask for a better service Top notch!! Keep up the good work.!!"

Very Good Experience
Great rides
"First of all the driver cancelled the ride and waiting period for another to accept. And before booking the ride the price is low but after reaching the destination the final amount is too high without any long traffic or changing the route.Uber has became useless to use, deleting the app and another new users don't use this app. Uber rides are scam"

Greate ride and clean cars

"Uber driver takes longer routes than on GPS. Difficult to submit a complaint and when responded to, the message stated that the amount was correctly charged for the amount of time and distance. This is however irrelevant as the problem is that there is a charge for time due to the Uber taking longer routes. Really disappointed in the user experience."
Excellent Service

No problems at all.
Always the best
Uber charged extra Rs. 21 for no fault of mine. We waited for the Uber for 5 minutes could not see any Uber taxi we had no option but move from that point and you have charged me Rs 21 instead of questioning the driver.
"I,s danger app"
"Please take a screenshot of the final amount that is displayed whenever you schedule an order. Uber will often remove any promotions applied, and the Help will ask you for a screenshot to make the adjustment. The app is designed in a way that there is no way to get that screenshot when an order is delivered."
Ok good
Uber is now like a scam I request a ride with a certain amount then when I reach my destination the price suddenly goes up bad app
"Do not use Uber on a daily basis. Uber and it's driver are inconsistent. You can't even provide feedback if a driver cancels you when you've been waiting for 30 minutes. Most, if not all, promotions are lying to you. Especially the Klarna 50% off when it isn't even 50%. And payments go thru pending when you ask for a ride, not when you receive one. So if Uber cancels your 20$ rides 5 times, guess you dont have 100$ until it falls back into your account at some point. Terrible experience overall"
Good
Safe driving and time saving
In this app caption don't pick up me and automatically he went to the destination how can he stared ride with out the passenger and not cancelled ride on any request so iam deleting this app😾
Very good series and seving ap
"Bloody money making machine without any regards for passengers - rides are cancelled, not accepted, even accepted rides are cancelled. Drivers call, ask the destination, then cancel the ride which was accepted after 15 min. Also, never be dependant on Uber intercity, especially for urgent travel. There is no customer support or contact center for grievance redressal (and Uber knows the service is pathetic). Edit 4: Permanently deleted Uber app. It is the worst thing ever for cabs in Noida/NCR"
All uber auto drivers are interested in long route ride they keep cancelling the vehicles...wait time is always long. Poor services by uber ..
Gud job

All was good before I tried to purchase a ride for other person. They didn't give me any notice that I already ordered smth and I've got 3!!!! identical rides without opportunity to cancel any or to answer to the poor drivers who were looking for me there. And I don't have any opportunity to complain on bad service on their website because they don't have normal customer service!!

They keep removing the option to request a new driver from rides and they've replaced their help with a completely useless chatbot that can't help with anything
"Uber allow their drivers to charge customers to use the 407 without their prior consent. When trying to contact customer service or any form of help, it's extremely difficult to find their support line via the app. The request goes to a robot before a live person replies at their convenience and it's difficult to continue a conversation with them or find the conversation on their app. Terrible user experience when in need of assistance."

Nice riding.more comfortable.
El detalle es que no encontró viaje en dos ocasiones y me pedía una tarifa extra para buscarme un viaje más rápido había coches pero como nonpague esa tarifa para buscar más rápido las dos veces no me encontró viaje me hicieron perder mi tiempo y llegué tarde a mi destino por confiar en Uber

"I am extremely disappointed with Uber's surge pricing. Recently, I encountered fares that were 50 times higher than normal, which is simply unacceptable. This kind of pricing means that one ride could cover my transportation costs for four days! It's frustrating to see prices skyrocket just when I need a ride the most. I will be reconsidering my options for transportation in the future and may not book an Uber again if this trend continues."
Great
They lie to much on they're waiting time it says a driver will pick you up withing 4 minutes and then you end up with a driver that's 20 minutes away... Sometimes I feel like they take advantage of us and still charge us the max amount of money.

"Es una buena app, sin embargo, es totalmente desagradable que permitan a los conductores cancelar los viajes cuando vas esperando como 10 minutos para que llegue a tu destino, es realmente frustrante que pase eso, especialmente si estás con el tiempo justo, si es que el tiempo de espera es largo, debería cobrarse la mitad del precio del viaje para que no estén cancelando a cada momento. También es de mal gusto que ni bien esté por acabar el viaje tomen otra carrera. Decepcionante."

Uber has way over 500million people using their service & they act so greedy stealing money from customers who want to be loyal. Uber needs to be sued!!! I'm going to do my best to make it a class action lawsuit. Uber is getting out of hand. If my issues are not resolved, I know something Uber doesn't want made public."

Uber drivers gets paid 17-20 a trip or order just to waste 30-45 minutes driving around random neighborhoods before they actually do the job they're paid for. Let me tell you the quality of humans that do this delivery BS: people with no marketable skills or future plans who would in no way respect other's time to be able to keep a normal job.

It is so unfair that the driver cancells on his side without even telling me and the uber app expects me to pay for the cancellation on my next ride.

"El servicio ha demeritado bastante y el precio ya no es atractivo. Antes penalizaban a choferes los que cancelaban los viajes, es una pena que ya no lo hacen y que cuando canceles a ti como usuario te quieren cobrar el viaje completo. Uber black no tiene coches de lujo, solo son los BYD de Vemo. Tristeza total"
No earlier outstanding still charged in next ride
Prompt service with best experience!

"Althought It's convenient to use this app, yet, at times, the navigational aspect is not up to date. It takes you from a much longer route making you reach the destination very late than it should have been actually"
It is very good app but sometimes the fair price is different in riders app. It shows cheap fair price in mine but when the riders arrive he would say that the fair price is not what shown in my phone and charge little bit more amount.
Helpful drivers no matter uber pets or uber always on time and Helpful
great service
Wonderful experience with uber
Not pick up on time very bad service 😡😡
Very nice 👍🙂
Never worked properly... Stucks alot... Never find the rides on time... Worst app

"Your service is completely unreliable. Instead of fulfilling our needs, you prioritize showing off and doing unnecessary tasks. You bring us from distant places only to disappoint us. This is an extremely poor service, and I will never use your service again."
Best app for cab
Uber no longer shows the fare before boarding on the trip here in Australia.
"Worst company, how can you let your Uber drivers not return an item that left in their cars. Your customer service is not doing anything they just let go of the driver."
Good
Very nice
very good 👍
"Whenever you ask if I want to rate your app now or later, I pick now. And I give a one star rating. Please stop giving us a fake choice."
Nice appp
always great service. i love my uber
exelente servicio
Better then Lyft hahaha
Fast updation of pickup and drop options

Pls intall this app
Love this app!!! 😍
It's amazing experience for me
Good
Some diver extra charge. Uber is good riding platform I love it .
Excellent 👌🏽
"Worst service ever, while booking the cab they will show in lower price and after the ride gets over they will charge double the price was mentioned. When you try to contact them they won't listen you also."
Excellent
good experience
Goog
Very nice experience
No customer service. They stole almost $100 from me
Bhout acha tarika sa or safely phocha da ta hai very good uber workers and good luck
"Uber is reasonably priced mostly, but can get pretty expensive when low on drivers. They are always reliable, but I just wish that they had a flat rate."
Worst app never using it again after i got out if the car
I love it
BEST experience
No support or customer care number to call for riders issue with a trip. Driver cancelled the ride even after paying and I did not get a invoice for the same.

Very comfort and economy ride
Very good
Good but Expensive. for Family Travel best package
Good 👍
Always accurate ...so far. A great majority of the drivers are very courteous and no problems with their driving. It sure beats the hassle of parking on trips!
Ride share now takes 10+ minutes to find a driver sugma
"Great drivers, ON time and very friendly"
Good 👍
good timing good drivnig

App did not show me the amount until after I committed.
Very nice
"Update: Uber sucks yet again, showing misleading ads for discounts in email and push for discounted rides, making it really hard to tell Uber one only. Shady garbage company, this should be illegal and reported. Uber sucks even more than before now, shows short initial pick up times when requesting then changes it to very long, then charges you when you try to cancel cuz this is not what you ordered. Garbage."
Easy and comfortable
"It searches and searches and searches, but no driver is available. This has happened for last 5 times. But in Ola I get the cab, strange."
GoOd
Top notch!
Awesome!
quiet
It was a smooth ride with this driver. I so much like his driving.
I would give negative stars if I could. This is the most unethical company doing business on the internet these days. They spend a lot of time and energy making sure that they don't have to talk to any of their customers. Expect multiple charges and small additional surprise charges after service is completed. Beware
"Horrible , there is no way to describe issues with account only what they want you to select a 25$ ride cost me 938$ and i can't get by money back. This company should be under review by Google and investigation by police"
"It changes price after accepting said price, Uber is purposely secretly trying to make customers pay more than what is agreed to and accepted for route, but after the ride the said price always magically changes to a higher price"
I love Uber...❤️❤️❤️
Good in all
Superb
This app is so helpful.
Ahh good
77 dollars to go to my court house which is two miles away the old cab companies would charge 15 this seem like money grab company
Significantly more expensive than other rideshare apps like Didi & legitimate safety concerns not taken seriously - have experienced drivers cancel my trip after I'm already in their car and request I bank transfer them for a ride as they "already saw my destination and are going that way anyway"...
Mr. Goutam are very helpful person. Thank you so much bro
Non stop stupid notifications on an app you need notifications
It's good
Amazing services offered
Good experience please try uber
Worst service ever his driver charge extra everythime
Only service i use
First time user - great service

Uber is dishonest and greedy. I'll delete this review when they delete my $175 charge for a ride that ALWAYS costs $17.
Good
Excellent service and most drivers drive with care
Awesome ride
👍🏼
Very expensive for a short ride of 20 min......almost $50/ not good
Best Option For A New City Comer
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOM
Nice experience with uber
Punctual and reasonable rates
Not able to do schedule ride for my friends & family members. App Developer to do fix for this issue
"When you deliver a packge if you don't select Express, it can take quite some time, like looking for a driver when you're already at the time of pickup, but expresses the way to go because they don't have any other stops, rides can be expensive at times, or drivers skipping over you because you're not going far enough for their liking, other than those it's fairly decent"
What did we do before Uber? Reliable and reasonable
"Disgusting service. My trip is usually a 5 to 7 quid journey, on a Tuesday night I had to call a family member to pick me up, no one will take the trip and if they do they can cancel on me at any point, I do believe I'm being charged for cancelled trips as well. Drivers should carry out every trip they accept with no way for them to cancel until it is complete, I will no longer be using this pathetic excuse for a service, even if other options cost more, they're not stealing from me at least."
Well done
"Drivers are amazing 👌, Uber as corporation, are ruthless, rip-off merchants! Support the drivers. 🙏❤️"
"Is your trip going to cost you $20 or $200? You have no idea as Uber no longer provides price estimates. It might tell you it will give you a quote AFTER you book, but guess what? It doesn't. You literally have no idea what your going to be charged until they charge you!"
"Charged my card 165 Euro instead of expected 20 Euro. It was corrected quickly after my complain, but I still find it odd that their system allows this to happen."
The drivers are prompt and friendly. And met a couple of good friends
No way to contact support.
Very kind top exp
Good
Nice service
Always on time
Great
"Would give 0 if I could. They took money from my account randomly, said it was an ""authorisation hold"" but wouldn't tell me what for, or if my PayPal had been used by another account. Their CS ended the conversation with a survey even though I was clearly distressed as an autistic woman so they obviously don't care about disabled people! They also didn't answer my query clearly. Deleted my account, never again. Also realised they never refunded previous holds!"
Hard to navigate the app
"I was not able to reach technical support for this app to tell the team that their app miscalculated the tip according to United States government travel regulations. All support options terminate in AI, and the support email address bounces."
"I have been using Uber for years with no issues, and the drivers are all wonderful. But since the latest update, the app gives me a pick-up spot and gives the driver a completely different one. Not only that, but today, the third time this has happened, I was charged MORE than the initially agreed fee due to the app error! I shouldn't have to pay for Uber's mistakes. Please sort this out!"
"super duper uber i love to enjoy ride and very affordable price, pocket friendly every one wants to enjoy your ride with affordable price and good service so download now uber app and ride offers, Fast service, good service and be a part of uber family ❤️😊👍🏻 Jana he Kaha ,Uber Le jaye oha Uber He Saath , Sochane ki kya he baat I love Uber ❤️"

Terrible when you have a concern. None to address.
Best app and the best drivers
Driver took us home when no internet to request ride home please pay driver for ride home from our card on file.
Easy to use and quick response to bookings.
"It good at times, but it keeps taking my money. And there is no way to reach Uber reps. Can you provide a number please.?"
Sooooo thankful for Uber!!! Gets me to work and Wal-Mart when there's no one else to ask! Safely❣️
Darren was very nice an pleasant. Car was very clean and smelled wonderful. Would highly recommend Darren. Thank you Darren.
This past few week finally uber cheaper than Didi. WOW
Bahut ahaca and fast safly
La seguridad que le están brindando a los pasajeros es casi que nula
Experience with Uber Drivers have been excellent. The ap is a little clunky to get used to but overall it is okay.
Exceptional⚛️
So comfortable
Good experience thank you
Okay 👌
"Worst Customer Service ever. They want to charge me 1,580EUR instead of 1,580TRY (= 45EUR). It's been almost a month and I've just received a message responding to something that It's not even related to the topic. Now they sent a message saying that my account is suspended until I don't pay. So basically, I'm trying to solve the issue and they suspended my account instead of fixing their mistake."
Good person
"Ashley, was very friendly and I felt safe with her. Definitely will recommend her."
I paused my membership until December 4th for financial reasons. Today is the 3rd...my bank account has been charged the $9.99 renewal fee which I was not prepared for and I'm very unhappy about that! I've contacted support multiple times today via the online submission form. No response yet. So unfair you do not have support via live chat or phone. Desperately need this resolved today. Cancel my membership and refund my $9.99 please ASAP. I'll update my review based on how this is handled.

"so Salvador gave me a ride from Visalia to East Palo Alto.( 173 miles) After another driver bowed out. He is super respectful, hold good conversation and I even learned a few things I didn't know on the drive. I recommend him to anyone that has a longer journey. Or even a short one. I'd give him more than 5 stars if I could. thank you Sal."

Had a pleasant and comfortable ride back home. Driver was courteous and friendly and his car was clean. I ain't thinkin about using the rest out there....happy with Uber
Best experience
I recuested servis 1 time the uber. Never sho up
I've never seen so bad support organisation like Uber support. I switched to competitor Bolt.
Super and very friendly and patient 😊
Every driver has been courteous and professional. I enjoyed the experience each time. Thank you so much for being there!!
My best choice uber cab👍😃
Good
Quick. Much more convenient to Uber when you need a ride quickly.
"Always quick service, and very friendly."
Just take a taxi.
"Vehicle was clean, smells good and great conversation."
"First time ever using Uber, and I used it to help out my sister who is in another town. Thank you very much. Loving this app"
Great company great drivers and when there is issue support handles it with care and fixes the issue or make right.
No matter if I drop my pin right on my house drivers still drive by. Always end up calling them and directing them to my location.
Nice
The quality of uber Cars in Cape Town is abysmal. Many uber drivers have told me there is rampant bribery for roadworthy tests. The quality of cars shows. Really terrible as I used to depend entirely on ubers for social travel.

Terrible! Horrible new drivers are coming on and it's getting worse by the day. First it was uber eats drivers stealing food so I had to delete the app now idiots who don't know how to use GPS and can't communicate are now in charge of our lives?! Deleting this useless app!
Nice

This is best but sometimes cab go another side for example I want to go chandpole yeh mujhe church ke samne chod diya
Always there when I need 'em
The worst app ever. Forcing someone to use only one mode of payment..shame on you
Always a pleasure to ride with Uber drivers. Quick pick ups all the time
Nice quiet smooth ride.
I love how fast they are and better than the modern day cab
Great driver and friendly
Good ride

"First taxi driver this morning was taking me to the wrong location, but luckily I realised we were going the wrong way and asked where he was taking me. I gave him the destination address again and he turned round. Wasted 30 mins of my time and cost me double the price it should have been. I am angry about this and would like a refund."
Easy interface

Pathetic customer care service. Tried both chat support and call support but they are nothing more than uttering repeated apologies.
Very nice company drivers always very polite
Nice
On point👍🏾
"Once it had excellent service,but for last one year service quality going downwads. Uber auto is totally useless. Drivers except the customer but after waiting for 20 to 25 min. The driver cancelled the trip. This has happened not only in peak hours but very frequently. My ultimate waiting and cancellation by driver after 10 to 25 min. Is common with uber auto and cab both. Request you to give some thought otherwise it will not be beneficial for you and us both ."
Great!
Convenient
"I absolutely hate Uber Eats. Use Door Dash instead; when they say free delivery, they actually mean it."
Nice and friendly
Exceptional service
"For now, you are the best!!"
Good 👍
Questionable wait fees. The driver was late because he said the app provided inaccurate location information and I get charged an extra wait fee?
Good
Very efficient .
"Planned ride came early, left, and charged me anyways, plus a cancellation fee. #unjust"
Very friendly app
Very Worst....Namma Yathri is a Best
Good service
Have spent hours trying to set up an account but NEVER get there so after going round and round and putting numbers in from email and texts and EVERY time being told it is the wrong number I have given up as it is SO ridiculous
"I wish I could rate zero. Uber is an untrustworthy, unethical, theiving organisation. We ordered a ride for R636 but paid R966 (more than 50% extra) after they added more than an hour to the trip (we were dropped at 11h39 but the ride ended 12h44). They also added more than half the traveled distance (nearly halfway back to starting point). When I queried the discrepancy, they told me the fare was not eligible for adjustment."
I always have a good experience.
Excellent trip with uber app
"Polite, eager to help, on time"
Good
Very good
Most disgusting app I have ever seen. Each and every time pay more than the ride.
Awesome
Useless application. They are practically thugs.

Excellent ride
Friendly and professional!
Very Good Experience
Nice to travel 🙃
Nice work
Good
sometimes it is the most irritating thing when waiting for more than 9 minutes. And it also provide nice rides. it is a 4 on 10 thing
This app has developed poorly over the years. They now have hidden fees that arent applied when you order a ride then later are showed in the receipt. It is unfair and they should show all fees at the beginning of your ride. I am deleting my uber account!
10-30 minutes waiting time still no cab was booked. What's the use of such low rates if no one was to come. Very poor service.
The payment methods don't work in the Netherlands!
Super
"Overall good, just one point to improve is when drivers are intentionally delaying the ride when they want to cancel, a direct customer care contact should be available without any waiting"
"Always showing XL vehicle only, small vehicle not available"
Service was good kept
I like Uber
"Uber for Business is a scam. They are unable to issue a simple invoice, so what's the point of going through the trouble of setting it up?"
Thanku
"Horrible company, I purchased food from uber eats, uber sent it to the wrong location and I was charged the full amount as a cancelation fee. Go to Lyft. Do not use uber!"

Always underestimates drop off time. Unacceptable.

I live in outskirts of Kolkata and I didn't expect that I would get uber in outskirts. It's awesome.
Nice
Poor customer service and you are charged before you are even given a driver. This has happened to me several times and it's a hustle to get a refund when the driver cancels on you yet your money has already been taken out of your bank
One of the best ride service I think everybody should try it.
"The app works. The drivers are great. However, when I am running late and I pick a car that says 1m away, I expect it to be 1m away, not 5-10m. I spend tons of money on this app. Please try to make wait times more accurate if possible? Also why am I soending more money for the faster option (4m wait time) only for the faster option to turn into 6m? Make it make sense"
Reasonable prices than other apps
Must ride
Very good
Great app
On time
"The worst cab bookinv App I have ever seen, whenever in need never got a cab or an auto due to either traffic scene or in emergency. It will be good if Uber shuts down & I would prefer to use other options."
"All they do is rob you of your money and never return it. They overcharge for trips, drivers will cancel rides in front of you, and you still get charged a cancelation fee. Their customer support is even worse. This app is a real life scam"
Good driver
Awesome
Excellent service by a diligent driver.
Good & best app
"Useful but prices are higher than what the driver even receives, long wait times like 10-15 minutes unless you pay for their premium or whatever."
"These guys get 1 star just for existing and being better, somewhat, than taxi's. I pretty sure Uber hires whoever applies. People who are on the clock but don't want to work. Accepting rides then canceling well after some time then getting stuck with ""searching for drivers"". Tldr; run your company better."
Much better availability than OLA
It's not working it's a bad situation it's not working very bad app 😕
Good app
Worst experience I ever had with uber
Easy to use. Once you know how to use it. Convenient
Great service
Safe and nice journey
It's very good.. I am deaf and sign language.. pls message me by whatsapp.. driver can't understand message
"The most disgusting and most worst company ever seen. I recommend not to use UBER at all in america. Late, tricks and so on"
Uber super service
Excellent and quick service
supar
Perfect service!
Nice
Best of the apk
Well behaved captain
Drivers are slow. They will sit and wait for heaps of orders before dropping off. Results in cold food. Also had continual seal breaks. Don't even know what they did to the food. Yuk
No proper booking. Demand extra money for 2km.
"Great app, easy to use and book"
Very much fine
The lady that picked me up was very sweet nice kind I would very very recommend her to anyone she is excellent at her job I'll give her a million stars if I had to.
Price increase without any reason after dropoff
Very Expensive and long waits. If I have to wait extreme times it should be cheaper. USE lyft their prices never go extreme and they got fixed rates now. BYE UBER UNFAIR PRICING AND LONG WAITS
Uber is better than other apps. It shows nearest vehicle available. Only disappointed due to 100 charges of cancellation.
Good service
Fast Good very more sms
Useful.. clear...fast...safest...
This service gets worse every year. Wait times get worse. Pickup times are never accurate. Drop off time are never accurate. Ride got a little cheaper but at the cost of taking it from the driver's and making the quality of service decline. 👎
Best ride
Ti ok
Very convenient
Gud
Takes a longtime to come
I like this application
Nice
Very nice
Good ride
Service level has really gone down.
The worst app ever... Shows you less amount while Booking when you reach the destination the fare goes high like really high. They cancel the ride 10-15 min later after confirming and we be waiting for it to arrive. Never book your ride through this app if specially when you're in a hurry to go somewhere.... Takes forever to confirm and charges you more. Other apps are way more better and reliable this one. This app really makes you so so so frustrated. Even ride captain asks for an extra charge
Excelent
Good 👍
Too good
Excellent 👍🏻
Was on time and very polite
Professional
Good
Awful customer service.
"I booked an Uber from Nalya to Mwanda Road for 18K, but the driver got confused with the route. After waiting five minutes on road to reach the destination, I was charged 31K. Then, for a two-minute drive from Mwanda Road to the next point, I was charged another 10K, making it 41K total. Sometimes the charges are inconsistent, with different amounts shown to the customer and driver. Drivers also cancel trips themselves or demand extra charges. This needs a solution."
delivery is not free everything gets hiked up on the orders price i understand that but don't make out it's free
Very good in other state for quick rides.
"The app displays one amount to the customer and a different amount to the rider. What kind of app operates like this? When we pay, it leads to conflicts with the drivers. This issue needs an immediate solution."
It's a now a days painful service in Bangladesh.... Driver ask where want to go than cut the phone cancel trips several times......every times happening this...it's too much annoying.
Amezing experience
waste of time and money
I always trusted Uber over other platforms but my last booking was pathetic. The driver harshed me by call and then uber imposed fine for the compensation. It was difficult to reach the costumer care service. It was late for the hospital. I have waited for more than 30 minutes in my location. I will never use this app again.
Good experience 😃😊😊👍🏻👍🏻
"Good service, rate of Rapido is little less when compare to Uber. Overall good experience."
All good
If You Payment Cash Or QR. But uber shows you're not done payment.. and they stopped service
Ismael was great he arrived in 5 minutes he was very polite and helpful. I definitely recommend him as an asset to Uber.
AI costumer service with no one actually replying to your concern!!!
Application have many issues
Excellent app

Stressful and app to confusing to use had to book repeatly got charge for app places I was at and then found it hard with driver to fix distanation and sort out ride and back really found it very stressful 😔😔
Doesn't give any information about the driver. If we forgot anything inside the vehicle can't contact immediately. Can't even contact local office to get any information all the numbers are fake.

I using uber from last 6 yrs initially the service was excellent but now it's becoming poor day to day
I am having worst experience of booking rides nowadays in Uber. Every time I pay to driver after my ride is completed. But when I again open the app next time for booking it shows me I haven't paid the previous amount. Uber should see what are the issues here. Why drivers are marking not paid. When I am getting late for office I don't have time to raise concern by going to help section and scrolling all over the options. And other option I am left with is to pay again for my previous ride.
good
Third class app
"Driver drove off with my cane. Uber wouldn't let me contact her and said I would have to pay $20 for them to even inquire. First of all, please have your driver's scan behind you and not immediately bolt. My hands were full and I was exhausted for waiting on work Honda was doing on my vehicle. They didn't complete the work, so I have to get back there and it won't be with Uber! Using Lyft instead!"
Awesome service
Kind and nice drivers. God bless you all.

"I have one huge problem - every time I book a ride, the driver keeps calling to bargain for a higher price. They keep asking for much higher prices and this is before they come pick me. There is no support where I can immediately report a driver for asking me a price higher than what was shown when booking."

Driver OTP le kar deliver cancel Kar deta hai or 140 rs charger dekhata hai anand vihar railway station me

I was charged way too much for a 10 minute ride with no surge. If I would have known that getting a ride would cost almost 30 dollars I would have not counted on Uber. I feel that the driver and myself were ripped off.
Good service
For my experience. In the app it shows 165 and after dropping the location. Cab driver told your charge is 265 . I said how it's possible. In driver app they show the photo. And in my app it's shows 165. Very bad experience. I would not recommend anyone
Uber driver asks for location and cancels everytime. Did it 4 times still didn't get the cab. Very frustrating.

"Every time I use the app, it tells me a car is 3 minutes away. Then, when I book it, it jumps to 15 minutes away."
Very important items for our daily life ♥️
Very good service...
Pague 578 pesos y me devolvieron 512 debido a las politicas de uber. Entonces las politcas de uber es robarle a los consumidores. Realice mi primer pedido para que me trajeran mi mandado. El conductor se equivico de orden y me entrego un pedido con mucho menor costo al que yo pague. Ahora tengo que esperar a que uber verifique mi peticion y esperar a que me manden un reembolso. Primera y ultima vez utilizando este servicio.

"absolutely one of the best apps ever made ,I highly recommend this business"
Have you started new way of begging for more money from users? Leave tip so then driver will accept your pickup. Seriously? This is how you force users to pay more money.
Excellent!! 10 stars if I could!!
Very well driver
Don't opt uber ....!!! Ull see one price at 1st when you book a cab .... When you at the drop location you will have other price much higher than that ..... For example when you are booking it shows ₹461 and when you are at you destination it shows ₹782 ....... Dokhaaaaa!!!!!
Exceptional driver
Good Performance
Nice experience.
Fair price
Good
👌👌👌nice ❤️
3 Dec 2024: I am giving them one star despite using it because their customer care replied in a smart manner (sarcastic/read illogical to outright rude).
Great
Helpful in needful times. Thank you for your service.
Love it. Works great.

"Frustran con los cobros al inicio del viaje, pésima parte la situación de pagos"
Is a good way to get around when needed my only complaint is that only certain cards are accepted as payment. Also and getting charged and the wait time to get refunded takes two weeks to get. Otherwise it's fair to midland

"Primero me gusto , ahora mi experiencia, solo alparecer tienen auto para 4 pasajeros, si son 5 te cobran 3000 o 4000 de mas. Algunos Mal caracter, El GPS los manda por un lugar, uno los guia para mejor y no les gusta, parecia bueno El servicio pero para mi no lo parece, a otras personas segun la zona les sea productive, gracias."
I tried to book a ride on uber but when I booked a ride it's show's a different pickup and also it didn't show me the map so I can correct it also they charge money on cancelling the ride. Even if the driver has cancelled it. That's the thing that make this service unworthy. Maybe other same service apps are costly but they provide efficiency. So much better then uber
Perfect timing And good behaviour
Very nice gentleman
Nice service
High prices. Go taxif
Bad service and worst user experience

"I had a great experience using Uber! The app is easy to use, and the driver arrived on time. The car was clean, and the ride was smooth. I appreciate the transparent pricing and the safety features like real-time tracking. Thank you for providing such a convenient service!"
Good
It works
Good
Price high
Today I booked cab but it is not booked and taking lot of time. Plz do not use uber. Very bad service.
"Just an FYI if you are booking a return trip form MEL airport, I cancelled when the plane landed because the driver was 50min away and was charged $35 for cancelling. I have no recourse, nor can I actually contact anyone. Don't prebook rides unless they are from your home."
Good
No way to see price without creating an account
"Everything so far has been exceptional, no issues to speak of so I will continue to use them."
One of the best. Excellent work 💯💯💯👌👌👌
Better than taxi cabs
Nice and fast service.
Very good app
Have you given liberty to drivers to do as they please? I have faced streak of 8 consecutive cancellations. Do their ratings not drop? I mean our ratings drop if we cancel the ride. But for them it seems like Uber has given them a pass...
Very good
Awesome. Awesome still.
Gets me where I need to go.
He was so wonderful!
Nice ride
"Tried to pay with paypal, tried to pay woth cash. Demands credit card... in the netherlands fcol. Noone uses creditcards here, let alone paypal. They kept demanding different payment money. Bottomline, my money is not good. Bye Uber (garbage)"

Great ride
Please take action against who are able and not pick up ride
No use in case of dire need and drivers always charge higher than the shown amount
Good service 👍
"First time Uber user here. The apps and registration including payment are easy! The price is reasonable, the driver was so nice too."
Better than lyft by far.
Good service 👍🏻👍🏻
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES 2 TIMES BAD DRIVERS TAKE UNSAFE ROUTES FOR MAYBE SOME ILL INTENTIONS. MAYBE ITS IMPROVED. NO ORGANIC BODIES USING. NO PO@RN.

Unhappy with waiting the time for an Uber and then when it's 2min away it switches to a different driver and have to wait even longer. With it being cold outside it's unacceptable.
Very nice
It's too extra you have to go to the extreme to just create account I'd rather do lift

a great experience. My driver was right on time. Even in this terrible weather she was awesome. Definitely use again.

I like the service but the app now requesting access to all files and images on my device is not acceptable. This is non of Uber's f***ing business.
Very good service

"Sad to say the execs at uber have let greed overtake them..the peak hours, fewer drivers, or bad weather situations and watch out, it's tantamount to PRICE GOUGING..... LYFT has been consistently $10.00 cheaper even during normal ride situations... Sorry uber, the Lil guy is just trying to get by much like how you're just trying to get over on the Lil guy, it's mutual, Se la vie."
support is abysmal. pre-typed responses that absolutely do not cover all bases. no "other" option. no "speak to a human" option. only pre-typed responses that are often useless. this is definitely by design.
💗
My experience was very great and I enjoyed the conversation with the driver that we was having.She's wonderful and I will suggest her to anybody
"Ubers pricing is ridiculous, especially since I know that they aren't paying the drivers enough, I used to pay 7-10 dollars for a 7 minute trip to work, but now it's more than double for the same trip, there is absolutely no reason they should be charging 17-20$ for a 7 minute trip, it's absolutely outrageous and predatory, my advice, find a cheaper alternative."
"Good but don't book an airport trip, not fair with late airline cancellations"
Great experience

I couldn't find my pin after a few minutes. I should never leave the screen until the driver has the pin put in.
Respectful
Happy and will do it again.
"I'm content with how the app works when I want to use it. But I'm deducting two stars for it sending me push notifications with offers even though I've opted out of getting push notifications with offers. It is convinced I have teenagers who are in need of Uber or Ubereats and keeps sending me notifications with offers for my non-existent teens. Dear Uber, I have zero offspring. I have a 15 year old but she is a DOG and is not allowed to order food. She also dislikes car rides."
Slow nonexistent customer service their going to get sued for it 100% Uber one at this point is malicious subscription at this point
No drivers found after waiting for almost 2 hours
Very very good service and price

Nice & nice person
Clean car. Took nice short cuts
Fabulous
"Uber is allowing drivers that were previously terminated and deactivated in Minnesota to re-apply to drive as of December 2024. I've already had sketch drivers in the past. Also with the new minimum pay law passed in Minnesota for rideshare, I will no longer tip drivers. Uber should lobby to have some of the new regulations reversed."
"App performs as expected. What I'm really pleased about is that Uber Green is now available in my city; the inability to request efficient vehicles has historically made me avoid Uber/Lyft/etc like the plague, but this is fantastic. Now y'all just need to let us request an efficient vehicle for Uber Eats and there will be no deliberation over which delivery app to use either!"
Very Helpful.. also affordable price pack
Gotta love the Uber. What a concept and only made possible by that damn technology I abhor so much. I miss the simple times of not so long ago but this is one thing good born of the present. Only recently took my first ride and now I'm hooked. Kind of like Goggle and what would you do without it? That's my story and long live Uber!
I've ride with Uber several times and have never had a bad experience.
Lovely!
User friendly and works beautifully
"Great service, on time, friendly, helpful"
Very good 😊
Service has become poorer and poorer over the time. Algorithm are geared toward maximum profit for the firm with zero regard for the customer. The drives are now expensive most of the time 3 times. And algorithm pushes to book expensive category or otherwise scares for extra wait time.
I am having a better experience every time I am using this platform.. I will defenetely recommend to everyone who is willing to have a safe and enjoyable ride
Better than ola aopp
Good
I appreciate this taxi service. It's helpful if the bus route is too long or the e- scooter isnt charged . The drivers are really hardworking people and friendly.
Good people is there ❤😌
Very comfortable 😊
"As a 1st time user, all went well."
Even I can figure out how to use this app.

This is the worst app. Customer support is non existent. Its absolute garbage. If you use this app keep a close eye on your bank and cards because it is riddled with scammers and there is no support to help you if you lose money to a scammer. Users Beware.

Horrible time estimations. Says it's gonna take 2 minutes and I've been waiting in the freezing cold for 20 minutes now. Switching to Lyft after this.
Sabse bekar app inke driver chor he aap book karo apko agar 300 dikha raha he to driver apne aap route change kar dega or apka bill 550 ya 600 bana dega mere sath 4 baar ho gaya 😔😔😔

Very good service 😃
Scam rip-off
Good
You quoted me a price then charged me 15 extra
"It was a good one, the driver was kind and drove nicely. Generally I enjoyed the ride"
Constant Cancellation. Lack of drivers. Useless in the morning. Takes money before even finding a driver. If your in a rush and are desperately trying to find a quick driver it says card declined and have to use another app.
Worst app dont donwload ....the drivers even after taking payment puts it in your side and the app keeps showing that you have to give payment in next ride and even the app doesnt reverts that back .... Prefer trying rapido for cabs or autos even prices are inflated in this app .... WORST APP ...
Best Service all times
Fast efficient and friendly service.
"I have been an Uber One customer for a long time, yet I'm charged more for every ride. I have been checking with standard Uber users, with same start, destination, and time, like today, one user without any promotion applied was $7.?? As I was $15.?? And even with 6% cash back, ARE WE PAYING TO HAVE THEM RIP US OFF? Onthe way I went to order food with free delivery and the buy o e get one free pizza it was more in fees than a second pizza is worth! This is a company that has no integrity!!!"

Great cab booking app with low rate booking

"After cancelling the ride, you won't get refund amount! It's been 2 weeks now! I'm still waiting for the refund. No response from the customer help center."
My driver today was great. Very professional.
I'm trying to cancell all uber payments

"When the drivers don't want to do your trip,this service becomes useless."
Best app for a ride

She's good on what she does
"It was a good drive, safe and fast enough to get me to my destination on time. Love it"
horrible application. they take the money the driver never shows and they don't refund me.horible experience
Customer support is a joke. Only drivers can get help. Now they are charging for trips that the driver doesn't show for. Do better uber and give customers a support option. Been trying to contact support for a week now with no response.
Good
"Since 2019, I have been using the uber and I had the first worst experience with the driver today, it really upset me at the same time I'm really annoyed by his behaviour towards me, while I'm heading to my workplace. He kept on moving backward while I'm almost at the end of the seat holding at the back guard tightly, he chose the rough sides of the road and made me really uncomfortable. I requested him properly to ride safely but he repeated twice. The end I yelled at him to ride carefully"
So super 👌 👍 😍
Convenient!
Awesome app
It is an amazing app that eases me from stress
Easy to use app....Excellent drivet
Very smooth drive

Bhut ghatiya app hai.. sab fraud log hi hai isme.. Payment kuch aur hota hai aur drivers kuch aur mangte hai wo bhi misbehave kr k.. Mai aaj hi ye Uber app delete kr rhi
Very easy to request a ride and share it.
I'm not the kind of person to spend the time to give compliments but I have had really genuine people that actually care about somebody give me a ride and I want people to know how much I appreciate them
Good app
Nice driver
"Experience as a female travelling alone, driver then added a charge a day later trying to take advantage. I have reported it to uber as only just seen the invoice on my card. I will post his driver details avoid at all costs... waiting for uber to find a resolution remove the drivers ability to do this without proof and refund me. I will name and shame."
No feature to report taxi drivers that overcharge or refuse to accept the ride because is too short. Something that happens often in Greece
Nice

Drivers are always courteous and punctual.
Uber sucks hardcore. You now have to order all rides in advance. You cannot schedule for immediate pickup it takes you into schedule a ride then it says one is available in 15 min but then you get an error cuz you have only schedule a minimum of 30 min in advance. Until you change this I will be using lyft
awesome

All the drivers I've had have been very polite and pleasant. On time and drove safely. I definitely recommend DeAngelo!
Best of for travelling

Uber is always fast efficient in the drivers are very courteous friendly and professional
"The driver act like they are doing you a favor more than a paid service, as well as the time that you have to figure out where the car is when you arrive. The GPS always takes the longest route with the most construction. The pricing is competitive & and fare, but the wait might be the equalizer to how fare the price but not the service. I use both lfyt & Uber as a means of transit & lfyt may be a bit more the cars. Drivers are a bit more accommodating, but Uber was the first n will always be ok"
Very nice services
Very safe and convenient.
Excellent
The worst and terrible app I have used. They will charge at a fixed cost and the drivers won't accept pre-paid payments because they want more payments from the customer. I personally had a horrible experience of booking a cab and the driver dropped me off from the car forcibly asking for more money in the middle of the night and the driver had a very harsh behaviour with me asking more money to give in hand other than paid in app. They will not consider your situation rather will demand money.
Excellent
Love it
Great rides from top rated drivers!
Nice and easy

"Never had an issue. Always my go to! 🙊🙉🙈 < This comment was my first, now let's update. The prices for my morning commute is inconsistent. 36 for a round trip was the average, and now some mornings soar to 55 for a round trip. It would be understandable if the vehicles were up to date, in good condition, or had a decent smell. Overall, you get want you pay for, but just hear out some of you customers Uber."

"Excellent service! Uber's app is seamless, efficient, and reliable. From easy booking to smooth rides, Uber has made transportation hassle-free. Kudos to the team!. 5/5 stars!"
"Gets me where I need to go. I would love drivers to disclose when recording. The new comfort feature is cool. Sometimes, I have the coolest driver and want to rebook."
Super
"Worst app and membership program ever. Customer service is useless, and if you have a problem with any of your food items, don't think they will refund or replace anything. They charge you randomly and more than they are supposed to. When I went to cancel my uber one membership,they convinced me to keep it and charge me $1.99 for the next 3 months, so I kept it. Days later I was charged $3.00 and then $9.99 again. Customer service told me it was a pending charge and would not go through but nope"
Okay it's good 👍😊

No coustomer care number is give in app and no solving complaint when I send in chat box and his auto driver is extra money when is drop on location. I suggest all people Don't book ride on uber app it is a fake application
They make it real nice.
"I am very disappointed with Uber's service. Since last week, I am facing the problem of drivers not accepting rides from my area even though it is a prime location in Bhopal. Despite being close, drivers refuse to come. Please do one thing when I enter the pin code of my area, the app should reject the booking itself so that I don't waste my time trying. If you can't provide service here, please stop operating in our area. Seriously Uber is providing such poor service."

"It worked great TWICE, then, it said that PayPal wasn't an acceptable payment. I tried entering a debit card in the UBER app, directly and it wouldn't take it either. 12-2-24 edit It works great. Out of about 60 rides in the last few months, only 1 driver did a no show, and I did a reverse charge through my bank. But, like today, the driver was very nice and safe. Nirebi is a gem. Thanks."

"My experience while using this app has been awful these last few months - I can't change my display to 'dark' mode anymore, and I keep on having to use a 4 digit code that is sent to me via SMS to be able to log in (I can't stay logged in either), and after I complete this process I receive an email informing me about a 'new device log in' like the app doesn't recognise my phone anymore even though I have had the same phone for the last four years (my number hasn't changed either)."

"Worst Customer service in USA. I lost a bag in an Uber in LA on Wednesday 27th November, and till now I haven't had any response from the driver. Uber Helpline assured me that they also tried multiple times but also unsuccessful. They keep saying that the driver is unavailable and left a notification on his app. They would also notify me if any response from the driver, but still nothing."
Bhai or thodi car badi rakho thankyou
"All positive, it's been good."
good
"The app used to be pretty good, but now it has become almost unusable. It takes ages to find a driver, and when you finally find one, the driver ends up cancelling the ride after a few minutes anyway. Absolutely horrible service. Other apps like Rapido take 5 minutes tops to connect you with a driver. Never using Uber again."

There are so many things to be improved. 1. Uber driver should not cancel the trip once he accepted. 2. Don't increase the price after the trip has started. It annoys the loyal customer. 3. The customer are annoying when the drivers do unnecessary cancellation
Good service
Affordable.. For years I used to feel indifferent about their pricing in comparison ...
I love the app
Good 👍
"Uber would take all awards if there ever was a competition for which app can leave all its users enraged. Your customer service is a joke, you don't pay your riders well, they charge extra and regardless of numerous complains, there's no change. Once, I had to pay a driver extra 40/- and then I raised a complaint, then Uber ""refunded"" me 40/- as uber cash, and guess what, the ride prices were hiked up by 40/- on my account only, I checked on other ppl's phone, no such price hike."
Super ride
Punctual

"Since becoming disabled, life is different becoming dependent, really stuck in the house with no transportation. Long story short not depressed anymore and my days are better with my Uber. I see my family and friends even though I can't walk as fast or drive. Uber allows me to get out and most importantly be there for my daughter and keep up with her...so thanks a million."
Good one raid
My last 2 trip were hilarious. Disaster customer support. Even Rapido and Ola has excellent service.
Overall good
Best option for travelling
"All okay, Card payment setup not working properly."

it used to be the best app setime back but now it's becoming the worst app... drivers can't find the location and ask you to cancel the rides and also they won't come on time also.

This is the worst app I have used. The cancellation charges are more than the ride itself. I am very disappointed and I would not recommend this app to anyone. Please do not use this app.
Easy to use excellent service.
More fastest pickup and lowest price and I felt a nice day
"This app is getting ridicule, I ordered a 15-20min ride two times and each of the drivers accept the order while arriving 18-20 minutes, them.being in another drive."
Useless app price hikes and scamming
It a very cool app
Excellent

Wayne was absolutely an exceptional driver and host.....great experience!
"Wrong Order, No Refund"" ""I ordered a simple meal, but when it arrived, it was completely wrong. I received someone else's order! I called Uber Eats to ask for a refund, and they said they couldn’t help me. I’ll never trust this service again."""
Very good
Good app
First it was taking a long time for confirming the driver and there is no option to cancel the process. So I closed the app. Then I took auto rikshaw and after 10 minutes I recd call from driver. Had to cancel and paid for nothing. Pathetic. Just money making trick by uber
Ride is good

"In general Uber is a great way of transporting people much better than a taxi. I had used Uber for the 1st time and 2 great experiences with 2 uber drivers. I went to Lort Smith Animal Hospital. But to come back home the driver accepted the ride and then said I don't do animals and he became very aggressive, agitated. I cancelled the ride while he was still standing outside his running car, complaining and asking me to cancel it. I'm new using Uber, I had to pay him $10 and asked x an uber."

Useless app... I Have been trying to book auto for an hour now.. it's not accepting.. I couldn't make it in time... Isn't it for quick ride?? But it's taking so much time to even find a auto!! Disappointed...
Not one auto or cab comes when it's needed the most. It is their job to take people where they want and not one accepts the ride especially during rain!
Good experience

"It is a cheating app. While booking the ride it shows as 42 rupees and it increases to 58 while dropping. Because of this, conflict is being created between drivers and us. There was no traffic also. Its their trick to choose their platform when compared to others like ola or rapido. I suggest everyone to prefer ola or rapido. Because their price is fixed and it will not vary like uber's"
Good
Not login
Tooo late booking
"It used to be the best riding app, but now it takes over 30 minutes to get a driver."
"Wrost experience, I never found a cab in time"

No-one will accept when you actually need Always Taking too long time
Easy to use.

Charging extra charge for cancelling even the driver has cancelled the ride and not starting before paying the cancellation charge And not any good service support
Excellent
Great service. Uber is my locality travel partner.....at anytime ✌️
Very comfortable
This company is a joke they take your money and they give you a big rice so they can charge you more I don't like this app
Want option to get an uber asap...couldn't see one?
"Always takes too long to accept my ride , mostly they don't even accept like for 30 mins straight"
Very good
The best....
Very friendly drivers and patient considerate and helpful
Innocent
Davenport uber never showed. Missed my flight Cost me a lot of time and money
This has got to be the best ride/taxi service in my area. Easy to use app A++
"The scooter app is awful. It will only sometimes show the option to unlock the helmet, thus having to end and restart ride, costing $. No ride/parking zones are not clearly marked on ride map. I've not been able to complete a ride without issue yet! The worst of all the ride options in Brisbane."
Very nice driver. Good driver in weather conditions.
Great service always 👌

Never installing the application. Done with the ride and driver (Suraj Pulavale) processed it. And asked to pay on his QR for Rs 101. Later on got to know it was processed as payment failure and now the application is demanding the same payment again. Ridiculous.
"Uber keeps on deducting money from my bank account for no reason. On my bank, it is written ""Recurring Card Purchase"" with a description written ""Johannesburg (Card xxxx)"". I don't know what Uber is doing with our banking Information/Data. And removing my banking details from the Uber App has not helped. This App is now a money-making scheme."
Good
"Pathetic service, always over charging and never available when required. I would like to go by walk rather than using this hilarious service. Shut it down."

"It's gud to travel with uber ,"
"The service was extremely bad , the behaviour of driver was unacceptable his attitude, the way he was talking..... A person books a cab when he have lot of luggage and a car have a ability and space for that luggage... I really don't even want to give a single or a half star because the service was not even worth that"
Extremely fast service in Tallinn

Not working at this time.
My car broken down and had a booked.doctors visit. 11km ride to langwarrin cost 31.00 approx this is a bit expensive for pensioners maybe pensioner discount would help. Driver was very nice and helpful
First time in a Uber an it was great I had 3 kids and a lot of luggage it had been already a stressful time but it was on time and the Nicholas was so pleasant person
Nice
Today I had very bad experience with your service. At the time of booking the fare shows as QR. 14 but later when I reached the location it was showing as QR. 27. This is not an appropriate way to charge extra.

Very bad. I am waiting for a hour and call many times but no answer and cancell the trip.
"Installed the app to get 5 people to the airport. Picked the Uber XL, confirmed, what do I get? A dude in a 5-seater asking if we are willing to sit 4 people in the back row. No way Uber isn't aware of that, they just don't care."
Super service.
Ola is better
Very perfect driver. Able to reach on time

I have apparently been banned for violating their terms of services for signing up and not needing a ride until now.
"During walking to the pickup location ride for $10 more expensive, and then driver is not 3 minutes, but 10 minutes away. Nice algorithmic scam, well played Uber."

"When Uber charges us, they automatically use any remaining Uber Cash first, unless we choose otherwise. So, I don’t have to worry about manually selecting it. Huge respect for that—companies these days just try to take more money off our cards."
I hear people saying Uber is the safest taxi app in kenya. I agree I only trust Uber for my night based trips

This is a good app I don't wanna lie
I very disappointed at Uber bc I of course don't have a vehicle so I depend on Uber for rides the prices have been high lately so now I'm having to walk with groceries and I have health issues bad it makes it harder on me and something needs to change I don't have family to help me and I don't have friends at all Uber you need to help people better not everyone has thousands of thousands of dollars and shouldn't have to struggle this way it's to hard on me
"Lovely man, even gives away chocolate and soft drinks"

"Clean cars, nice drivers, simple to use the app. Love the fact that you can see the amount before requesting for a ride. Really good service! 💯"
Great
I love this app
I want a refund with all this money I didn't know I had a monthly membership this is theft. I want the eft of all the money you have taken off my maintenance account. Contact me ASAP for my refund I'm going to court in January this better be refunded I don't want this membership refund for all that you have taken off now 😡
Still keeping it real.... awesome always
Scheduled pick up times can not be trusted. Over 20 minutes late for an airport drop off. Conventional cab services more reliable.
The customer support for orders is just of no use. They just focus on taking orders only but don't think much about the customer concerns. They just tell us to reach out to restaurant
Been quite a while since I last used uber. Had forgotten how quick easy and efficient it is. Excellent service.
"There are no support at all and many steps just to reach anything in the app, I paid extra of my fees 14 pounds and driver write in that pay less than my fees 14 pounds and I tried to reach any customer service two days and no support at all."
cant even add my payment cards shitiest update ever
Uber thnx and always pick & drop on time
¡Excelente!
One of the worse companies ever. Their whole support team is ridiculous and very unprofessional. The entire app is junk. I will never use it again
Hamid was amazing and such a delight! He went above and beyond with his service! First time Uber rider here and I will definitely use Uber again! Thanks Hamid. JENNA
Good service...

It's best Uber service
"They have terrible tracking of scooters, can never find them, and they gave away the scooter I reserved"
Safely reached home.
Quick and efficient..polite Can't ask for more
"Uber should really put harsher penalties by drivers accepting your ride and then cancelling at last moment. I can't describe in words how poor of an experience for end users this results. Drivers can get away penalty free after making you wait for more than half an hour and then cancelling at last minute, losing many other potential rides in the process. Riders have a job to do and are users, who pays for this app, put in a power inbalance w/ these unethical practices"
Need a way to connect with you when circumstances change need a number to call t b e driver
one star because I can not pay with cash it always says to change the payment method.

"I rented a car in the Old Port, and although it showed many available options, they sent a car from the other side of the island."
Every time face new wrost experience.When rider cancled ride then why you Charge cancelletion fees from customer??? On this reson i cant book my ride last 4 5 days.... Plz solve this issue
"Doesn't show the business ride profile in the app, which causes me to not be able to use the business benefits. I have to log into my account in a browser to access it. Went back and forth over email with customer support to explain they issue, and they just ignored it and repeated that I am enrolled in the system. Yes, I know...But what good is it to be in the system if the Uber app front end is broken and doesn't let me select the benefits because they aren't showing up in the first place?"
Great performance with Uber

"Uber is literally stealing your money everytime, from Unforseen cancelation fees from the driver's side to an increase of price by the end of the trip. I had multiple trips where i see the fee change from ex. R78 to R116, which was my experience today. Its extremely unfair to the customers. How does the app lose its network after the trip starts and then say the trip amount might be outdated? Everyone wont have the amount of money after the amount change."
Good
Good ride safe drive
Great service
Theft and scams the app. Horrible customer service. Don't waste your money. Uber will update prices and items on the spot and then charge you for canceling an order after coming 5 hours late with things you didn't buy for a higher total than you agreed to. They'll then wait 6 to 12 hours to get back to you only for them to still charge you.
"What have you done actually to this app and drivers? Is a mess, waiting 20 mins for a driver. Greed looks like it took over. Thank you for giving me a driver 17 min away from me, driving the opposite direction to finish the current trip LOOOOOOL You aint rewarding your drivers enough, and they went to Bolt, all of them. Keep staying greedy !"

"One of the worst services. If Uber riders cannot carry any luggage, why don't they mention this before ride confirmation?The rider accepted the ride, and when they reached the pickup location, they said they couldn't carry the luggage, even though it was just a small amount. Also rider take the OTP and forsed to us to cancel ride from our end,Why ? Please address this inconvenience faced by users. If you cannot carry even a small amount of luggage, please mention this before ride confirmation."

"I'm confused and outraged. I requested a trip and selected the option of an ""Uber Go"". It showed me the car details but, when the car came around, the details had changed. I later learnt that the app has switched me to an ""Uber X"" and that the trip cost almost double the cost of my initial trip!! This is simply unethical and is bad business practice!!! I'm not sure that I can use Uber again in future. I tried to report the incident on the app but I still haven't heard from Uber. Unethical..."

"The worst e-hailing service ever! This company keeps deducting more money after I’ve completed a ride. They often charge me over R20 extra for most of my trips. Mind you, the trips follow the exact same route, the driver doesn’t wait, and there’s never any traffic. Every time I query these unjustified deductions, I get an automated email claiming there’s no mistake. It’s infuriating! I’m the one losing money here, and they refuse to take accountability. Stop scamming your customers and fix this"

"This app protects, thieves, kidnappers and rxpists. As long as they get their cut from the criminal drivers, all is well with them. Be careful this festive season, especially women, those safety things of theirs, pins, recordings etc. will do nothing for you once Uber has decided that you can't hold them liable. Stop thinking that it just happens to others and that it'll never happen to you, being naive will show you flames."

Why the you guys don't have customer care number. I tried a lot my giving help options but not responding. I need to update my profile. Every time i need to ask permission from you guys . What hell procedure is this @uber . Damn i going to delete my account from your server. Last 3months im trying no one is reaching from your side.

I was booking a ride for 220 rs but in drivers auto price is showing 355
Nice ride
It was a smooth ride with a very friendly driver
I notice you charge customers different rates. I can use my other phone and a completely different rate. this ride in particular then I last check was $29 and some change on one of my phones the other phone the rate was 85.00 same trip. Plus you hit my bank account five times and pending with zeros trying to get to my account and you dragged I want somebody else that's known for causing fraud in my account. What kind of b******* is this.
Today I was unable to book vehicle. Really pathetic service Uber. App is disgusting.
Good
Comfortable ride
worst app in whole cab driving app. this app charges more than 300 rupee to change the destination only for 100 meters away from previous destination. and the driver's doesn't even care about the complaints "hanji krdo aap humari complaint". and this is just worst application.

Horrible. Wants you to pay more fore a faster ride so if there's no one around how are you offering a faster ride for more money ? And got stuck in traffic and needed to pay more than the pick up price at the end .also if it's raining the price goes up more than double??
Everytime same thing happened with me and that is:- can't find driver now. Totally rubbish.
Very good reliable service when it is needed thanks
Rip offs.

"For the previous ride I have payed the amount to driver, still asking me to pay. I have raised completed still not solved."
Very nice and convenient rides
Grate driver excelente
"So many problems now (used to be good). Can't update phone number. Driver demands toll on top of estimated fare. No customer care number included in app. Customer care number listed on Google doesn't work. Safety number (from blue shield icon) doesn't work. Fare increases automatically by the end of trip, despite not having any traffic on the road."
"Useless, takes money from your account without you doing anything. If you call them, they ask your statements and Useless things like they own ur money.. what a unless company"
Thank you

Nice cheap price better. Than ola
2022: How do they justify going from 10 dollars to 30 dollars in less than 3 minutes and freezing your queue line so you either wait it out or pay an outrageous amount to go a little over a mile. Your looking more and more like a scam than a business and lucky you can't receive less than one star. Update: 2024: Uber is still a compay bent on scamming its consumer. They just tried charging me 37.58 to go 1.2 miles. I will freeze before that. Dumb business mismanaged model.

Very Very poor. Never like Uber. You can't reach at rider location. Times and cancelation charges has to bear to rider.
Policies are good but costing of vehicle rides are million times more than public transportation which is why I hate this app

A new scam is started where in company shut the vehicle on the road an the care doesn't start an the drivers make u get off an mark the trip as completed when it it not when a car breaks down but u dont have an idea if the car is broken down or they have shut on purpose am sure many have put reviews but uber doesn't care not a reliable source of commute also expensive
Excellent service

"Worst App, Driver cancelled the Cab due to Price , he asked 3times the money and they charging the money from the Customer Bakwaas App, they are charging twice the money when compared to Ola and Rapido"
Don't use this app Price showing something else driver asking more money and have dispute with me on road. No option provided by uber to connect with customer support So that express their problems
Clean car and friendly driver who prioritise client safety and satisfaction
It was my first time experience and it's incredible the driver is also polite with good driving skills and price was also reasonable. so from now onwards I always going to prefer uber ride
Taxi s are scam.They accept then they want me to cancel.I prefer Marti Tag
Nice trip to my distinction

"No way to file a complaint if you don't download the app. However, make sure that you enter your specific address, because if you don't, they will only get a sequence of numbers with a street name. I work as a security officer and we turn the drivers around all the time because they don't have the proper address."
good
Sometimes confusing
"If time's are hard and in need to be somewhere,Uber is really the only option seriously and sadly. Sometimes the app shuts itself down for unsure reason also so it's frustrating on the downside of this"
Worst cab app
We payed more than what it showed when we booked the ride
Worst customer service On 19/11/24 I booked an auto the driver cancelled and I was asked to pas the cancellation fee On my next ride the app shows the cancellation fee of the previous ride with ride fee . And I paid for the time being and when I filled an complaint the was showing Rs 19 were refunded to uber wallet but the Balance was showing 00
Excellent
Very good app as compared to ola and rapido price is quite good
Super easy
"Poor and Inconsistent Service Quality!! I've had enough with this service. The quality is inconsistent, and recently, it has gotten even worse. They send a quoted fare for a trip, but once I accept, the app suddenly demands double the fare at the end of the trip !! This has happened not only to me but also to several of my family members. This is blatant robbery disguised as a service! Avoid this service if you value your time and money!!"
Price 💀 reliability ✅👍
App keeps logging me out every day. Pain when I'm in a rush and need to reconfirm my acc and log in. Also forgets my saved locations each time.
good service
Useful app
"1 Dec update: Day 2 in row of slow connection to drivers. Day 2 that I've used Bolt instead of Uber. Bye Uber! GPS issues, poor cars, a faceless app with ZERO customer service. I chose Uber over purchasing a car. I'm changing my mind. Update: March 2024. Still the same. Uber as a business areca nameless faceless entity that dont care. So yes. Bye Uber. You've lost my daily business that you've been getting for almost four years Update: Dec 2024. Just worse and worse. Hello Bolt. Goodbye Uber."
Very good service providers
Very good experience with Uber keep it up
Need more promos and discounts
"Becoming a useless service provider as years progress. Customer support doesn't care about serious issues including escalations. Most of the drivers remain unprofessional and ill mannered. Multiple feedback or suggestions given to Uber do not seem working, forcing its long time customers to avail alternate services."

In coimbatore I had a Worst experience with uber auto they are demanding extra charge equal to half of the fare extra what's showing up on the app and when we ask them they are rude. I think you have look into this matter.
Wait time is too long better to walk than to book a cab from this app
Good. I appreciate the fixed rate for trip at the time of booking and the same at the end of trip instead of leaving to driver's decision as ola.
"Nice, comfortable drive to home"
The drivers are not good they are charg extra money if we are not giving then they are shouting

"Uber services are getting frustrating day-by-day, especially at railway stations, airports, and bus stands. First, they take a lot of time to search the cab and confirm. Thereafter, wait time remains pretty long. More than often, the first driver cancels the ride. Then, one has to repeat the whole process with much increased prices. Uber must come with a more robust system and substantially increase no. of cabs."
"Would give less if able, constantly cancel and up the price"
Best app to book cabs i booked 8 cabs in 2 days and had a wonderful experience the drivers were also good and uber also has cheap prices than any cab booking app.

Its so sad that now you keep trying booking a cab but you request takes so long to get accept that there is no merit of booking a cab ...and this is not a one day story ..you can try it anytime..drivers keep on skipping ...happy efficient life
superb
"The app is of very poor quality. My location and the route are not synchronized with the map. When you move the map, the route and my location shift incorrectly in relation to map. This makes it very difficult to find the driver, especially in unfamiliar locations. That’s not the only issue, but this one is by far the most frustrating."
Good
"I used to find this service excellent, but after having a no-show on a pre-booked (prepaid) trip to the airport I was disappointed. Gave Uber another try and after 12 cancellations over 2½ hours, I'm positive I would never again recommend Uber."
"Pretty expensive, but works well and quickly when it's your only option for a ride. Very useful."

I'm from Ranchi City and Uber works really well for me. Till now booked 3 times and the cost was low compared to local services. I hope it continues to provide us same service for long time. Thanks its a great experience.
Fantastic ride with Michael
Extremely slow
"Worst experience I recieved from UBER service, one driver accepted ride request for my 14 km trip, his arrival time is 12 min at my location, he cancelled the ride before 2 minutes arrival at my location, I didn't get any kind of consolation amount or cancellation charges from uber side for this inconvenience, if this kind of activity is done from my side they will charged cancellation charge, but in this case customer didn't get any inconvenience charge, no value for customer time."

Lovely gentleman. Beautiful clean car . He was chatty
"Simple, quick, good service and reliable 👍"
"Many times driver have cancelled the ride by themselves but uber charged me for that ,, and now my ride was showing 433 when i Booked and after reaching the location at the same amount of time that was been given, the fare increased itself to 597 directly 163 rupees increased , this is a scam"
What are you messing with here? This used to be the best idea ever and now it's a lottery. Booo!
These guys changed my credit card after I had canceled my ride. I couldn't get 1 person to help me & they were rude. Be careful with these guys because they will charge you without your authorization.
My wife had a terrible ride the drriver tried o abduct her and uber hasn't done o cared one bit

"Precisam dar a opção de reclamar sobre corridas não feitas, o piloto chegou na minha porta e cancelou sem ao menos parar praticamente e ainda mandei mensagem que estava no portão e ele mesmo assim não voltou!"
"ESTA APP ES UNA ESTAFA. Solía ser buena, pero ahora la cantidad que cobran es aleatoria. Pueden cobrar cualquier cantidad entre lo que ofrecen cuando pides el viaje, y el TRIPLE, sobretodo si la demanda aumenta en tu hora de llegada. Además, está llena de ""errores"" con los cuales te cobran dos veces o multas cada vez que la aplicación tiene una falla. Los repartidores suelen poner que no has pagado nada cuando pagas en efectivo. Las estimaciones de tiempo están todas reducidas. NO USEN UBER!!"

got dropped off at wrong spot and no reasoning with driver to take us to the right area do had to walk a mile up a dual carrigeway in 4 degree weather not usinh this app again
V.good
Best ever
I was charged a waiting time of 35p when other people sat in the car by mistake. The wait was because the driver let them sit in and then they had to leave to get into their own taxi. Not my fault for delay of a few minutes. That is why uber is getting a bad name
Great 👍
Jesus Christopher was very polite and helpful.
Very impressed with the service and a lovely safe driver.

Very bad to take money from people's account and not turning up then tell us the driver cannot locate us . Does the location not show on your App before you find the driver.

"When I requested my last trip, the app said I had a 30% promo applied, I chose that trip with the 30% promo applied, I paid the new amount via card. Hours after completing my trip, I see that a new transaction has been done on my card, only to find out that the promo was canceled after I had completed my trip. So I was charged the original amount without the promo. But when I chose that trip, it clearly showed that the promo was applied and hence why I chose that trip."

"PLEASE UPDATE YOUR MAPS!!!!Prices seem to grow exponentially sometimes, it seems like they are trying to reach infinity. It seems like the driver is the master of the ride and the passenger is bound to constantly be a victim in some scenarios. Drivers can leave you in the road when you really need to get somewhere in time and maybe you get your money back, maybe you loose your appointment or plane, but they are never sanctioned for their actions. Drivers can do what they want, no repercussions."

Worst in payment adjustment. They'll ask you to add min 350/- money in wallet and make it use for their own benefit. You'll see null balance once ride completes
Why is there no option for Uber pool or uber share in city trips or any other trips? Location Bangalore and Kolkata

much more convenient then taxi's much quicker to arrive when ride is requested. but they have trouble finding addresses and then I'm charged waiting time.
Great driver good route taken
It is good but when the drivers cancel the trips it's difficult then to find another immediately.
Wonderful
Very polite and responsible cab driver
"The service is becoming horrendous. Having been told by 2 drivers that they won't accept anything below a £10 fare I'm left waiting for ages before I give up & go elsewhere. I've even had drivers accept my request then cancel minutes later which causes me to be late for work sometimes. Used to be a 1st class service now it's just not worth using. Even right now I'm needing to go somewhere, costs less than £7, nothing unless I want to now pay £22.85 for a 10 min journey that was £7 5 minutes ago"
I have book a cab at ₹400 initially but when reached the driver asked me to pay ₹470. As it shows to his app. Later on when I complained about it the company refund me the extra money. Recently I faced this issue with my every ride book.
worlds no 1 one third class app 😏😏 disgusting
Why should i pay a fee of R65 if the driver was not at my pick up point and he didnt respond to my messages?
Much cheaper
Bad service
Very reliable mode of of transport
They sent me promotion discount (20% off next 5 orders)so I placed an order 2 minutes after. There was no discount on my order. Ubers response was that promotion expired. And Uber has the right to cancel any promotion at any time. Poor customer service that is extremely hard to find.
Very nice experience uber
Easy to use; the app walks you through every step.
"Wrost service ever seen, purposefully location is selecting 500 meter distance and drivers are not ready to come to pickup location Uber app is also not allowed to delete my account. While login it will login with OTP but while deleting profile asking password which I have never created Uber is grabbing customer money with Amazon account"

"Now a days in uber, rides are not getting accepted.. atleast don't show less price keep it reasonable but rides should get accepted in few minutes... otherwise it's worthless"
"Uber charged me around 20 rupees for the ride that cancelled by driver because driver was unable to reach the exact location for pick up. Also, other Drivers charge extra money for small distance destination."
simple & easy to go around your long-distance journey without having an issue.
"""3min pickups"" that take 20min to arrive have became unbearably common, so much that is obvious that Uber is not being honest about them. If it's going to take a while then at least let me know in advance so I don't spend all this time waiting in the scorching sun."
Waiting times are currently terrible.

"En República Dominicana los conductores de uber están cometiendo fraude. Si les pagas en efectivo (con propina) existen conductores que colocan que no le he pagado el total (me ha pasado 3 veces) y la aplicación me suma un monto extra en mi próximo viaje. Cambié a tarjeta y a pesar de que pongo propina, algunos conductores aparentemente desconectan el internet del celular y uber identifica que el viaje a pesar de que ha llegado a su destino, sigue como que no ha terminado y incrementa el pago."
This app scams people.
Best ride
Third class application never books proper ride and if I don't get ride for 10 mins straight i cancel the ride and then they shadow ban me for cancelling a ride which has no driver or car allotted to me.... Third class application... Ola is way better and helpful
it was excellent
"A Lingering Payment Issue I've been a long-time user of the Uber app, and generally, it's a convenient way to book rides. However, I recently encountered a frustrating issue that has left a sour taste. I booked a cab and opted for the UPI payment method. Unfortunately, my UPI transaction failed at the end of the ride. As a result, I had to pay the driver in cash. Since then, my Uber app has continuously displayed the payment as ""pending."" This has been going on for over a month now."
Good
Good for anytime
Very easy an secure
Perfect
Can't even log in click on app pops up with Uber and the black background screen and that's it won't shift of that
Good and helps alot but please don't charge customers extra money just because they didn't get to their destination in time due to traffic jam its not our fault.

"Paid for a two stop uber. When we got to the 1st stop which was a corner store just to run in and grab milk real quick, I walked out to find my driver gone. I called him and texted him numerous time to find out where he was, got no answer. Had to walk home 1.5 miles away which took an hour. And Uber only have me 97cents back as a refund. Absolutely no help at all. Dude could of have left me for dead and what would have been the consequences for him or this app ?"

"Erra o local de embarque o tempo todo. Informa um tempo para chegada completamente aleatório. Só é um pouco mais barato que táxi. Constantemente tem corridas canceladas, ou não consegue encontrar motoristas, causando perda de tempo. Agora, colocam propagandas, que atrapalham a visualização da corrida."
Bit pricey
"Uber rides are decent, but uber eats? Put wrong address, unable to change my address through the app, meal gets delivered while I'm trying to contact customer support, customer support is unable to assign another driver to deliver my food and wastes my $. No refund."
"Regardless if the app is updated to the latest version, it always days it needs the update. Garbage"
Drivers don't turn up and go in opposite directions. They clearly use Bolt and choose not to cancel trips. I've taken over 130 Ubers and had the same issue for years in several countries. The automated in-app support just says that you're not charged. They don't punish drivers or compensate users for their inability to get a grip on the problem
Good app I always get my rides on time.
Best prices all the timee
👌👌
Nice
"Decent fare charges, Driver is friendly and good.... Satisfied with the ride ..."
"Fare is too high ,The place is not farway and not having any traffic but charged double amount"
The best taxi to booking app period
"Terrible update. So much more difficult to navigate. Not user friendly anymore. Takes 3x as long just to get a ride. Used to be one click essentially, now there's a time that you need to set but it's 30 min from the current time. And just overall a hassle to use. Will no longer use until it's fixed."
Gud person
Very good
Most pathetic experience I had ever felt..... waiting for more than 1hour and that driver doesn't come to the location easily accessible....... people choose these services and they get frustrated every time......
Good app

Excellent trip
"Nice app not it is very important app when we travel every time n any where we need this app so it will helpful for us n u ,,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Very nice aap
Super
Good and affordable price
"The fare price changes when the ride ends. The route and timings were same, there was no difference."
Good
Well Behaved.
Well the app is nice but sometimes there are tecnical issues. Sometimes the fair is wrongly calculated because of tech issues. The Main problem is not this but that there is no place to voice your problem immediately. Such kind of resolutions must have direct support from tech teams but i don't find anyway. I can't keep waiting I would have to resolve it by paying whatever needed and get it resolved later. Be more convenient at least!!
Very usefull
Great app and better than taxi
"There's no response and no way to reach as sometimes their drivers go off the route and take longer route for their own interest and on putting feedback, there's no response from uber"
Uber you're the star of the show. 💯
Terrible experience when something wrong to hard to talk to someone I was two hours late get some live voices
Good 👍
"Disappointing Customer Support and Unresolved Charges I had a terrible experience with Uber recently. I was charged X for a canceled ride, but the amount was never refunded. Instead of charging the Y cancellation fee, Uber kept the entire X. To make things worse, I had to request another ride for more than X to get home. I tried filing a complaint through the app, but the option to attach a screenshot doesn't work, making it impossible to submit my issue. This is unacceptable"

"You will get cab every location , not too much fare amount."
Bahut acha app
Nice and good
Great service 👏 👍 👌
🇿🇦: not sure if I'm the only one experiencing these things but more than once my trip with a driver will not update my location and once I arrive at my destination my driver will tell me I need to cancel the trip because he can't mark it complete on his side. I've also been charged extra for trips where a driver marks it complete away from my destination and had drivers wait outside my house due to app errors on their end & refuse to leave until it's sorted - uber safety no longer a priority.
Excellent service
"Extremely frustrated by the service offered by uber...whenever you book a cab ,price shown on the app is half the price asked by the rider on addition to that amount, they even ask for more..."
I used uber for long time and I was OK they do a great job. But amsterdam uber keep me 1 hours less or plus a bit waiting and they keep changing drivers many times. Till I gived up. But at the end I had a great gentleman [uber driver] dropped me to hotel.
"Great.. Been using for 4years now and it's phenomenal.. However a little efficiency when the drivers are not available would be appreciated.. Like just tell us that there are no rides, don't keep waiting.."
Good 👍🏻

Some of the drivers are really nice and very helpful. Yet others are rude and driver fast and with one trip the care smelled like wet and damp.

"I use uber and I en joy the app because it's really useful and helpful , when on a rush from point A to B."
very poor
Fast delivery
App could do to be a little more 'drunk' friendly.
Great experience and easy to use
Every time I try and get a ride on this app the driver ends up cancelling several times and I have to wait for over an hour
Now app is not showing trip fare which is clearly a cheating with customers.
Previously I used to travel by using uber services but now a days it is difficult to find a transport in the requirement time.Mostly we are searching for the nearby drivers like that it took hours also no response from the drivers suddenly they will cancel the drive like this then need to go for other option like ola or some other services kindly ensure to provide your ride services to customer on time.
Quick and reliable services.

The rates are going much higher nowadays plz control that The bookings are delayed It's becoming inconvenient to get a auto or cab quickly. Plz work on that too.
"Very disappoint from this app, When , when I have to reach on time , This aap never find my ride on time ."
The legitimately need to fix how they handle things on this app I should be allowed to give drivers a one-star even if I canceled I just got charged part of the fare for the driver's time even though in 10 minutes the driver had not moved which is ridiculous I shouldn't have to pay for your driver not doing their job
Your payment methods is sucks as a foreign how do you expect me pay with cards and all other methods I use cash coz I'm doing my errands
It was so much cheaper than the other company in Zachary.

"UBER Shuttle service in kolkata is not at all good. There is no stoppage at certain locations, please have a stoppage at Howrah Station. Last day I went to the pickup location waved at the driver so that I can cross the road and ride the Shuttle. He just cancelled the ride at that moment. Very bad experience."

"Most pathetic app i ever see, most of time either ride got cancelled or driver ask money and intentionally waste our time and later you need to use other app, this is like normal for uber"
It's the best app for mobility
Good but the driver cancels the phone before pickup please do something about it
Ride booking takes longer time

Verry good service and best ride experience and cost of ride is low compare to other travelling aap like ola
Driver is polite and helpful. Nice experience
"Uber cheating on delivery fees, check your receipts !!!!!!!!!!"
It was good experience but .....if you're rider is good than your rides are also good
Friendly and on time
Great app👍
Wow every single business plus this one made inflation have unbelievable prices everywhere. Uber prices up 1000 %. After Jan 2025 I'll check your rates again and if they haven't decreased back to a reasonable rate I doubt you'll stay in business
Good and effective but prices are abnormally high for few instances and drivers wouldn't accept ride or asked extra money. Drivers used to cancel requests also.
Good experience
"Uber is getting worst and worst day by day, cab driver is accepting the ride but not moving showing same location and not responding to messages or calls, Uber's customer support is also not available to discuss about the issue, the worst service they are providing now a days. Even food delivery apps provide proper customer support about the delivery of the product, but Uber is not even good at the customer support"
Good
Wait tym is too long
User friendly application
Best
"UPDATE: 3 TO 1: just checked uber. 31 dollars for a 4 minute drive vs Lyft's 5. Uber is a joke. Lyft is the exact same service but cheaper even without the extremely helpful price lock system. I still use uber occasionally, but I'm beginning to trust lyft to provide the same service for 40% less the price. The gouging on surge prices uber uses is just, it's just absurd. It's far more expensive on average in a city, and even rural trips are just more without surge. Uber is joke."
Always and all time satisfied with ride
Serive is better

"While booking the ride price will differ before and after Worst, they charge extra everytime"
This application is very good and this app helps us and also costs less money.
You cannot rely on this app for accurate time of arrival estimates. You cannot cancel Uber One.

Today's Rider was best..
"It's more expensive than at regular taxi cab. And if you cancel the driver coming at you, you have to pay a part of the ride, even when the driver takes forever to arrive."
"Waste app and wrost policies and wrost help line and no proper support, After done the ride I have paid Cash to Driver which is showing in the app, After 30 minutes when I have open the app it is showing still on ride, and after that when driver got another ride he has colsed my ride then it is showing 3 Times more price then booking, and Uber wants me pay 900 rs for 259/- rs ride. Waste app, only driver and cabs favourites One not for rider. Waste and wrost Appp and service I have ever seen."
Exilant
"Far better less cancellation and quick booking keep it up uber , far far better than other competitors"
Initial price was low when we ended the trip the fare was too high

"stolen idea, copyrighted in 2004 from Australia"
Very timely. Needed to get to airport quickly so as not to miss my flight.
Middle of the city. Empty ubers everywhere or parked up all waiting for that extra quid or two rather than confirming. 20-30 min wait. Unless you pay the 'priority' pick up of course. Black cab cheaper. Good luck
Good way to get to work but some driver are bad but to be fair I get more good then bad
Good driving

"Absolute rubbish... Had to wait for ages to find rider. Finally got connected to one that said it will take 17 minutes. When it was 1 minute left, rider cancelled... Back to waiting forever. Appalling service"
Great driver and service
Good app
"The wait time was very fast. The drivers were very friendly. There is a problem with the site. It's much too harder getting into the website. And you guys website doesn't accept my bank card anymore. I did contact my bank, they said that IT'S THEIR WEBSITE THAT ISN'T accepting my card. But, guess who did? Lyft."
Good
"When it's busy, wait times are not extended.. but the price is, which does not go to the driver at all, the company just takes it all. I payed 80 for a trip, the driver got his standard rate of 24$"
Very useful app
They absolutely ruined the app. This new UI is horrendous and ordering a ride takes longer some how
Great 👍
I've been using this app and uber for years pretty much when it started. These last few months SUCK and customer serive was garbage. I placed a food order and it switched to a different city. lol I notice it the first minute and tried to cancel but you have to go through all this other stuff before you cancel the order. But I finally cancelled it within 2 min and they charged me $49 and told me I shouldn't have cancelled it. Ummm I wasnt even in that city.
Wonderful driver clean car smooth ride I highly recommend this driver 5 star in my book
Good service
Quick friendly and cost effective
Good safe and fast
The app keeps changing my actual location from where I need to be picked up resulting in drivers going to the wrong destinations
"The driver was friendly, and he was diligent with his driving!"
Respectful and clean
Very good 👍
The experience was awesome
Ok
Good trip driver was very nice and helping
"Very pathetic app , very pathetic... Always shows there is problem even if boarding points are changed...."
"Con artists projecting a trip costing way more than it actually does, this company deserves to be bankrupt"
"This has got to be the worst app on here. I have tried MULTIPLE times to reserve a ride. I select the date days in advance, the time, etc. It says it's confirming it, then bam. My ride is happening immediately. Then I get charged a $25 cancelation fee for immediately canceling a ride I booked to be days in the future and not immediately? What a scam. Update: After speaking with customer service, I was refunded the cancellation fee. It still sucks that this happened in the first place."

Phenomenal service at a tip of your mobile with fast satisfying service!

Uber is a very reliable and friendly service and I really appreciate the fair prices and I find that the Uber drivers are much more friendly then regular cab drivers always a interesting experience!

Lovely lady . V chatty with 4 old gits on it 👍

"Prices lately aren't kept. At the end of the trip, they always charge at least 50% more without previous notification."
👍🏻
Uber prices will have you paying R136 UberGo for a 2km local trip that normally costs R27-R40. They blame it on the high demand but it's just plain daylight robbery.
I originally used uber back in the day but after a driver decided not to transport me because I had to go food from the restaurant in Vegas and then with uber eats I got sent a raw fish and they refused to reimburse me I canceled. Now I am trying it again. It still is not the most affordable in city limits but they cars are of better quality and cleaner
First time uber user! Love it
Very good service thank you. Miles better than Drive Taxis. The driver was great.
Uneducated driver keep cancelling cabs doesn't understand any other language except kannada.. should atleast recruit them by checking if they can speak atleast one universal language.
Excellent 👍
"Great driver, clean vehicle. A pleasant ride."
Excellent and affordable
Muy amable y muy bueno
Pretty awesome 👍👍
"I just LOOOVE how y'all conveniently gouge your ride prices as soon as I'm about to request one. This has happened quite a lot recently and it's beyond aggravating. I wouldn't be complaining if most of the momey went to the drivers, but y'all have become so greedy and arrogant like everyone else, and I all i can say is that I wish y'all an unpleasant moment in your day."

Best App For Minimum Charges to ride
This company and app Is the worst to work for. Please do not use them. They will take your money and there is no support from Uber support. Worst company I have worked for. Also there security is horrible. There background is a joke. They have so many people driving illegally and delivering to peoples houses and there illegal and some even are crooks looking for the right moment. Be careful if you order from this app.

"I'm disabled and have a wheelchair, most drivers don't want to drive me when they see I'm in a wheelchair and it's usually the african drivers. When I book a ride they give me a price but when I get to the destination the price change and then the drivers get angry and swear at me. Pathetic service. I'm deleting the app and my account after this."

"I have been using uber app from last 3-4 years. Driver Asked me to cancel the ride while I was keeping the bag in backside and then he runn away with my laptop bag kept on the front seat. After multiple attempts to call center got his contact details. Then after 2 hours he came and demanded cash of Rs 5,00 for returning my bag. Very rude behaviour of driver. Made me feel unsafe. Doubtful I will use uber from next time"
On time and safe
Uber has a very friendly interface with their passengers. It is highly to all who are on transit to make use uber.
The app always takes the drivers the long way and it's very inconvenient for riders
Good
Affordable
"Have you ever noticed that the price shown to you at the start of the ride is not the same as that charged after the trip? You are not alone. They do this all the time, charge way way more at the end (even if the route, distance and time is within the bounds). I would suggest, move to some other app instead of relying on these cheaters"
"Your so called Driver Madarchods are asking to pay 1000 rupees for a 35 KMS ride. Besides they are forcing us to cancel, now your app is not allowing me to book a ride. Just let me know what kind of trust I have to place in you."
Good services

"New update today (29th November 2024) is awful. Drivers unable to detect my location correctly, and says I am 2.5 miles away from my pick up point."
"Show's amount is correct, accepted ride early"
Good
I was happy with Uber until I got charged for waiting time when I was the one waiting for the driver.
"Warning: everyone be careful with Uber Eat. Recently, Uber Eat specializes in taking orders from you. Today, my relatives and I ordered food from a Vietnamese restaurant for nearly 5000 rs, requiring online payment. Then the delivery person informed me of the wrong address and canceled my order, so I lost money unjustly. A few days ago, my friend also had the same problem. I promise I will never use Uber Eat again. And will warn my friends and relatives. Extremely disappointed."
👌
I was very happy with this appp But today i could not have been veryyy much disappointed double the amount for traffeling seriously i always use uber but today you disappointed me i usually paid R150 to R170 but today OVER R200 SERIOUSLY
"I'm tired of all the over charges. Wrong pick up locations always wrong drop off. Made up traffic charge, made up waiting charge. This is every time."
Very friendly driver
My driver was very polite & considerate also on time!!
"Very convenient app, sometimes exaggerates on the price, reserved prices shouldn't be more expensive than realtime rides."
Good
Love uber
"The app is not without merit but I've had a bad experience with the highly promoted car rental which has resulted in me losing a fair amount of money. The flow to rent a car is deceptively simple - lacking transparency on some of the requirements - and the TnCs are vague at best. Do yourself a favour and don't bother rent through Uber! But if you must, run a DVLA check first... If your record is anything but spotless, assume the hirer's won't release a vehicle and Uber will make a tidy profit."
Reliable
Worst App. Ola is faster and better than you
Awesome
Very nice app
Very good. Driver was courteous and driving safely.

"Booking a ride if a complete failure in uber as ...the app is auto applying coupons and making charges so low that drivers are not accepting any ride...facing too many issue where either there is no booking even waiting for an hour or after accepting a ride, ride calls and asks what is the amount and then cancels the ride...truly pathetic"
Good and happy about it

GPS messes up. Switches pick up and destination spots. No customer services.
"Good prices, most drivers are polite and chatty. Normally is very quick in picking up unless the roads are busy then the app will inform you and 9 times out of 10, the drivers will listen when you direct them the faster route."
Why can't I cancel once rider has already started the trip. Because he hasn't picked me up
One of the best app for travelling with affordable rates and safe driving.
A great trip today
"Prompt pick up, smooth journey, polite and professional. Thankyou"
Your prices are really high Hate from india
Easy to book prices is perfect
"Useless Use that wait and save option Wait 15 minutes Still cant get an uber. What's the point of such options then? This app only works when you dont need it to If you need to urgently get somewhere, rather walk Underpaying drivers Overcharging riders Useless"
A great app
Awesome first ride in a while
"Hard to reach customer support, careem is better in that aspect but uber has better drivers"
Worst experience
"Paid for a ride. Driver accepted. Driver canceled. Then, to order a new ride, the fee suddenly jumped up hy an extra R30? Ridiculous."

Drivers are in time good
Good service 👍
Extremely bad service the worst ever I have never experienced such poor service waiting more than 3 months for feedback pay what I owe but a day or two later must pay extra also never received a parcel that was supposed to be delivered by me 3 months ago but paid for the parcel and for the delivery
Excellent service provided by him

A safe ride with a professional driver always a good trip
Excellent service
Good one..
Cannot switch payment method from cash to debit card. It says try again.
"Convenient, Economical and timely means of conveyance to one and all."
Very efficient . love that you can see where you are going. The drivers certainly know what abd where I go 😜

"My worldwide taxi bit high fare as compared to local app, uber can work on single debit card for all countries for frequent traveler like me"
Nice service
Low price
Can't seem to get any help. The call feature doesn't work either. A ride at peak time is costing $25 to go 1km to take my special needs kid to school. That's over $60 a day(after fees) to take my kid to school. TAXI is cheaper.
Good
"Very fast, easy & I live the whole voucher program that's included,"
very nice for unknown person.
"Worst app ...it was shown rupees 138 before I start a ride ..but after reaching my destination, driver was showing rupees 213 in his phone ... What non sense is this ?? Is this a joke or what ?"
Great service
Worst ever!!!! Shows wrong direction so that they can charge more.Shame on you!!
Many times you return money and charge back more for 10 days old trips. Stop fooling people!
My preferred way going from A to B.
Felt safe
"My driver had an accident and I injured my hand and leg. And I didn't like his behavior, even abused him in bad language. West Bengal kolkata"
More convenient than others
"Waste of time no cabs coming, bcoz cheap rates, uber app pushing drivers family to road..."
"Never had a problem, all the drivers ive had were wonderful, quick, and nice."
Uber super
Good
Good drive jng
Great rite at right time reach airport. Nice driving
Good service
It's refusing cash payments for whatever reason.
"scamsters! stil sux. gets suckier everyday. always random charges and when i do make a booking, they charge me more than the price we agree to. and sometimes charge me twice like wth. i get tbia charge AFTER getting in the cab ro reaching destination so they make it too late ive lost over 1000 on uber messing up and havent seen any of it back. they SOMETIMES get back to you when they mess up. but they're ALWAYS messing up and its not worth paying more for nothing than the service itself"
Good ride . Cooperative
Affordable price
Excellent experience
It was ok
Nice experience

Proper fair but need more rider to include.
It was wonderful. And safe...
"I use Uber very frequently and have been for a few years without any notable issues or complaints. My pickups are quick and drivers are always very nice. Having this option, that is a lot cheaper than the local cab companies, is a much welcome and greatly appreciated convenience in my life! Update: Wrote this in 2022; it's now November of 2024 and I'm still loving Uber with no complaints! 💖"
Excellent driveing skills and a very patient driver
Worst app don't use it. Better use other ones
A smooth experience in my first ride with uber.

"Yesterday on 28/11/2024, I took the uber drive, driver delivered me at wrong location, it was not his fault as the Google map was not showing it correctly. My fare was 110 , he told me that you had to pay extra charges for extra 1.9 km . I said ok. But I didn't receive any message from uber , then he said pay 220. I didn't receive any message from uber about payment. But I paid him , but after few minutes I checked that it was 118 rs. I raised request in uber, but uber denied it.Poor experience"

Uber hikes up the price of rides if we look now and come back later. Overcharged me Rs.70
"I am very disappointed with Uber drive ...There is never any option for a bike on Uber, they only give the option of a car.So I am very disappointed"
Glady driven both miles. Seemed nice.
So far no complains. Useful app specially moving through USA.
Excellent 👍
I couldn't book my ride.. please solve the problem.
😊
"I missed my exam bcz of this application, continuously cancelling my rides and i have to wait 1 hour for the cab, .I had to wait for 15 minutes but still the cab did not arrive, it was a very bad experience...nd it's very frustrating"
Great driver and good service
Fully waist of time with this app. Riders not picked up and some time they pick but cancelled immediately. Totally useless.
Best
Superb

Great app
Not at all good experience at the time of pick up charge was around 298 and at the time of dropoff it suddenly changes to 403 even I have screen shot very poor price management very bad experience
"I've been using the app for many years now. Some months ago, when I reserve a ride for some hours ahead, it wont show up on my app and I need to stand outside asking cars if they're there for me Support is terrible, I've been telling them but no one seemed interested in fixing it"
"Every time this company charges me more money after a ride, no one should use this app."
"First time using it, and I didn't regret it. Nice"
Driver behaviour is very good
Good
"Whenever I try to call the driver through the application, I receive a message that it's a wrong number!!!"
"Useless app, most of the time, drivers cancel trips without reason."
Very good Parsons
Good app for request car.. But sometime dryvers hijited to came location.
Great
Nice Support
Getting Drivers takes a lot of time sometimes more than 30-40 minutes. Due to this my neighbours get almost late for their Train Journey
"Useless app now they even refuse to connect with the drivers and shows as 'sorry it seems that there's no vehicle available, please come back later' but it clearly seen that there's multiple vehicles available. Piece of trash."
It show the car and price but while booking it took above 10 minutes for updating about driver after 10 minutes it doesn't update any driver and automatically cancel the ride.
Great job
Awesome!

First time user. Understandable app. Able to make reservation more than a month in advance. Satisfactory update notices. On time. Professional.
uber की सर्विस सबसे ज्यादा खराब है। ऐप से ज्यादा पैसों की मांग की जाती है। ऐप में 114 rs दिखा रहा था और मुझसे अतिरिक्त 76 रुपए मांगे गए कुल 190 रुपए लिए गए। जो जल्दी में होने के कारण देने पड़े।uber अतिरिक्त पैसे लौटाए
Good service
Better than ola
"Very bad app ,worst does not work while it is needed , no option to choose the vehicle model... terrified.."

App is fine but the service is dependent on driver
"Driver well spoken, and ok for driving"
"Due to a personal emergency during the last month I used Uber here in George. I was a bit skeptical but was wonderfully surprised. Friendly, efficient and safe. Many thanks to the drivers."
Maha faltu app with many issue
Great always available and on time
Waiting time is too long I hv been trying from atleast 30 to 45 minutes no one is ready to come I tried to cancel and then agn do it but still no one is accepting What a rubbish app 1 guy accepted my request and then cancelled it for some nonsense reason I am gonna tell everyone to to not download this app and give 1 star to it I hv many contacts So don't try to act smart Uber app It's a rubbish and the worst app ever I hv seen in my life Ola is way much better that this
Good
Absolutely flawless service. My no. 1 transport service to anywhere in the world.
Some driver can not read maps. With that being said Some chose a pick up which is 20 min away from where they are it dies not make sense at all Uber is expensive. Most time the wait is very long Some driver play radio or music loud. Some driver are very polite. Some cars are very clean whilst others are.....

"No option to select drivers who will only accept electronic payment. Tried to use the service in egypt and was a total scam. The drivers started to haggle straight away and if you do not accept the ride, you still get charged for cancellation. Absolute joke!"

I have multiple large unauthorized transactions from Uber. I did not authorize them and they are not showing up on the app. But they are on my bank. Unfortunately its impossible to reach out to uber via phone. They are just stealing money and committing fraud by stealing money.
On time and friendly chauffeur.
"Takes forever to find a driver, and when they do, it takes driver like 8 minutes just to get to me. I live in a populous area!"
why it the app directing the driver to pick me up nearby rather than at the actual address? it is very annoying and causing me problems.
Comfort

Very comfortable and professional
Awesome thanks
"I wish there were negative ratings. Driver calling and asking where do I want to go, after knowing the location he cancelled it."
Money from my savings account has been deducted and i haven't even requested a trip from uber.I've checked those around me that may have my card details and none of them have used uber services so now my money's just going to keep disappearing.

"It's hustle getting a refund, that's if you are going to get it Till this day, i didn't get my money back on a canceled trip"
Worst app. They don't take any actions against their driver's inappropriate behaviour. Literally ended up paying twice for 2 rides as it still showed pending amount even after paying. No helpline no. For other issues excluding safety issues. Even after raising ticket multiple times no response from their side.

Won't be making use of uber for transportation anymore. They offer you a ride for R32 and then afterwards you get a bill for R52 without a heads up or even an explanation of why. The support is null in void. Seems like AI has taken over their support channel. Will only be making use of Bolt at least on their app you get charged one amount and they don't charge you more than what was offered. Uber has really gone down hill from the last time i made use of them as this has never happened before.
It's gotten so HARD to get a ride. 20 plus minute waits. Drivers who are late on purpose and hitting they're "here" 5-7mins before arriving. Do better @uber!!!!!
Good job
"I never used Uber, because when I first tried to make an account years ago. I was told cannot make account, as I already have an account. If I tried to login, I was told: this email dose not have an account. Fast forward to today: I just set up an account, and you cannot pick a custom destination: trying just won't work. I wanted to be dropped off at my Native Tital lands. But this app is still brocken trash."

Why the flipping heck are there ads on this app?
"It is a cheating app. While booking the ride it shows as 400 rupees and it increases to 680 while dropping. Because of this, conflict is being created between drivers and us. There was no traffic also. Its their trick to choose their platform when compared to others like ola or rapido. I suggest everyone to prefer ola or rapido. Because their price is fixed and it will not vary like uber's"
Good 👍
Prompt reserved trips...in luv it :D

Do not have frequency of cabs or autos even in crowded residential areas. It keeps finding driver even if I close my app.

Timeing super
"90% of the time Didi is cheaper than Uber for rides and most of the time its a $5-10 difference so a significant amount. As for Ubereats, why am I still paying ubers prices for food when I am picking up? On doordash the prices go down to the normal store prices as if you were buying from them directly, but on uber for some reason you are paying the full amount as if you were getting it delivered. Why would I use Uber at all if both Didi and Doordash are significantly cheaper most of the time."
Is not displaying trip details in the inbox. Cannot send thanks for the tip to customers.
Good app
Very good👍
The drivers are all polite and drive with care. I couldn't ask for a better way to get around in Columbus Ohio.
Wait and save is a scam

Never able to book a ride in the early hours.

It's not my fault you don't have enough cars on the road and I'm unsafe when your app says 7 minutes later I'm still waiting 20 minutes and I cancel and get charged I won't be using your services anymore

Ride was perfect driver was great wonderful experience will use Uber again thank you

This is an amazing app
"2 soferi mi au dat teapa, in sensul ca mi au marit timpul de așteptare se la 5 la 10 si apoi la 15.min.... m au sunat si imi ziceau ca nu ma aud desi ii auzeam perfect după care au anulat cursele. Si ce e mai rau, pentru care am dat si o stea este ca in aplicatie nu gasesc nicăieri cele doua cumenzi si conversatia cu cei doi, prin urmare nu pot sa le dau raiting negativ sau sa le fac vreo reclamație deși am așteptat in frig minim 20min la fiecare până au anulat."
The driver was understanding to me for not being 100% certain about the address.
Very poor quality car
This round trip was awful from the billing side. I was billed incorrectly...overcharged and misuse of my credit card. I will not use uber again!
Excellent driver
"No longer a useful app. Takes forever to assign a driver and then they cancel on the way to you if a better ride comes up. Customer service non existent. Call a local cab company, it'll be cheaper too."

"It's very convenient, and the people are nice."
was very good.
Very peaceful
Booking a trip is very easy.
"Charged cancellation fee and nowhere in app can you query or find out why. When you call driver, he did not answer. We had not cleared customs when ride was cancelled. Very very poor the way this is NOT handled with customer service in mind."
Tq so much
"Try and find customer service, similar to a 🦄 for uber!"
"I use Uber in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The only problem I've ever had is the pick up point at Crown Casino in Melbourne. Two different drivers claimed to have arrived but didn't. I received a $10 fee in my account. Apart from that I find Uber excellent."
number 1
"1. I'm offered pickup in 2-3 minutes, then cycled through 4+ drivers that cancel. Wait ends up being the period where drivers cancel plus 8+ minutes for the closest driver willing to accept my ride. It'd be better to spend longer finding a driver that will actually pick me up and not show me the many that cancel. 2. Ordered an Uber from the airport. Got cancelled after he was a minute away. Uber driver quality is only getting worse"
They are adding additional hidden fees and the drivers have been taking a lot longer. Consider taking a cab if you can.
"I dislike the fact that you only get the option for 3 people, why is there no 4 person option? Now I need to pay additional fees for 2 people extra that aren't even there. And this was never a problem when I first started using the app."
"App cada vez pior. Você fica esperando o motorista por 10, 11 minutos e quando ele está perto de você, cancela. Outros aceitam sua corrida e não vêm até você, te obrigando a cancelar e o valor da corrida ficar mais alto. 4 vezes essa semana eu coloquei a corrida de X para Y, CHEQUEI O MAPA antes de pedir a corrida, e o motorista foi mandado para Y para me buscar e levar para Z. Fora os cancelamentos antes de finalmente conseguir corrida. Eu pago o serviço, não é um favor que o motorista me faz."

"dejen de cobrar los viajes pagados con tarjeta dos veces, me ha pasado mas de 3 veces que les he tenido que cobrar mi propio dinero, y lo peor es, no hay ni una opción que te pueda ayudar para esto, LADRONES"
One of the worst experience from Uber in last 2 days. I have already paid the trip amount to uber still I am getting message that payment failed and devoted amount will refund shortly and unable to book the ride for personal work. If I am going to book ride then it says needs to pay outstanding amount to uber. Why I need to pay outstanding amount to uber I don't know. It's uber problem because I have paid amount digitally to uber and not getting refund as well then why I can move & repay amount?
Excellent
Very aacha

"Bad. I have repeatedly watched your navigational system input inflated routes, extending them unnecessarily. Unnecessary extra turns, driving through housing when not necessary and don't say construction I KNOW where the construction is in my small town. 20 minute waits for what is a 15 to 10 min drive because you're not taking the most efficient route is ludicrous. I feel like I'm being ripped off"
Very good service
Overall ok. Just cannot understand why so many times it "updates" the price to a higher fare just seconds after you have confirmed the ride. Price should be fixed to the fare shown at booking time. App should not let the driver cancel the ride after he has confirmed the booking. Just makes you lose tim

I have booked return pickup at night for my family, two driver called me that they are reaching to pick up and strength thing is that I see his location is near pickup but when I called him they told he far away from there. What is it if Uber don't have monitoring for that it is not acceptable. Finally I went to receive my family when thy book themselves for uber and the driver taken mony without any ride because"
Very nice and polite
The uber arrival estimations were off (either due to algorithm issues or driver delaying) and it made me late to my appointment. There is no way to give this feedback inside the app and no coupons were given. Poor service delivery.
He is very nice

The ads. Yuck. And the car tracking on the map is still awful.
Why are drivers charging fees for trip they don't even meet and cancel the time they want to? And why isn't there an option for customer support call? Are we supposed to pay charges for the trip we didn't even take?
Verry good and safe aap
Great experience
Compare to ola all rides on low price in uber
Next level app
"No me gusta que si yo cancelo luego de determinado tiempo mu multan, pero cuando un socio conductor cancela luego de estarlo esperando un tiempo, no me reconocen nada"

Very bad experience from uber as I have booked a cab for Rs 354 and they charged me Rs451 at time I left the cab I paid that amount as I was in a hurry But this is ridiculous there is not support option or help in app you can just give feedback for rider I have complained twice in app but no response The rider took another route and there was also traffic or moreover he was sleepy and so slow which made ride 34 mins longer than shown on time of booking cab Why am I charged higher I don't know .

Better than any other cab service

such a wonderful app for travel at affordable cost. thank you love it
Help and Coustmer care are failed
"Afte the completion of ride, driver asked for cash. Even after cash was paid to the driver, the application is asking to pay online. Wasn't aware how to find customer service number. After too many efforts the complaint was raised, but response that received was unexpected. They said we only address the complaints within 30 days from ride was taken. Hence had to move towards your compitators. You people are indirectly forcing to stop business with Uber.. Ridiculous experience..😡"
Good
This is a serious concern that Uber now takes longer time 😕.That is beyond the tolerance level
Great service Thanks
Such a gentleman thank you great service
If you like constant annoying push notifications multiple times a day then this is the app for you. You need to disable these notifications in two different spots. Why? Because f@$k you that's why.

"The later the ride the less expensive it's supposed to be because it's off peak. Not more expensive. Ya'll created this app to save people time and money, yet all you are accomplishing is wasting people's time and costing people more money. Do better."

Disappointing support features on the app. Took way to long to find the areas for support. A complete disaster.

The cost estimator says £5.99-£11. The app says £20!
I have been using this app for 2 years and the service has been great. But for the past 2 nights I've called Uber to pick me up from work and drive me home with issues. I put in my home address as my drop off location and clicked on my work address as my pick up location. The apps gps starts glitching and puts in my home address twice as my pick up location and drop off location. I don't need to be driven home when I'm already home that makes no sense. Please fix this issue immediately!!!!!

"Uber please pay your drivers properly. Every driver complained about Uber not paying them and charged us extra cash. Also the drivers discouraged not to pay by online payment but by cash. After booking the driver calls and extra money if we are not willing to give they canceled the ride. The culture of demanding extra cash ia getting too toxic. Please look into it. I'm writing this from Guwahati,Assam, India."

"Ride was good, and Rohit was riding very perfectly and talked politely."
"Using uber is big fuss.. drivers come only if it's cash payment, randomly if anyone accept online pay, they complain payment not reflecting in wallet/account and need to argue or fight. Additional to it don't have direct contact number for support to raise complaint. Support section is pathetic. If selected Amazon pay the it's more complicated.."

"SUCH A PATHETIC SERVICE. The Uber company is looting customers by charging them extra whenever they are late at the spot or whenever they are cancelling the ride, but never payback to customer if the driver is reaching late at the spot and even when the multiple drivers cancel on customer. Today I booked a cab which said driver will reach in 9 mins but he didn't reach for 1 hour and later I had to cancel the ride on which Uber will take charge from me only."

Always my go-to-app for despatch. Thanks to the team for attending to this aspect of ride.

"I use this at least 5 times a week, and I love it. I feel safe with my drivers, and I know I'll get to my location safely. 10/10 app and experience."
"Whats with the new feature of tipping? Even before the rides start, driver sending tip request. Doesn't make sense. 3 drivers canceled the ride because i didnt tip before the ride even started. Tip is paid at the end for exceptional service and not before the ride starts. Highly disappointing."
"I deleted it because every time I tried to book a ride, it sent me to the trains and coach. There are too many trains for our small street with no station or tracks. I have tried to restart the phone and reinstalled the app."

"Uber is the worst company ever, they refuse to reimburse me for a ride I didn't take."
Horrible. They are hiring drivers who unethical they don't deliver and yet the customer is charged they don't investigate you contact them. They don't reply. Worse you can't call them. Imagine experiencing the same bull with no help or explaining they are as bad as bolt... in 2024. Mr D is proving bettet
Wonderful

They Never give me a good rate for using them Every day for work....Then the more I use them the more money they charge me. I don't like this app. I wish we had taxi service again. I spent way too much money with them. They don't appreciate it at all!
Worst app ever they don't have proper customer service support due to that I had to pay extra in the name of due which I have already paid in the form of cash to the uber driver who don't update the cash payment details and earn more cash illegally and due to this reason I had to pay extra cash so I don't recommend anyone to use this app until they resolve this issue and add customer support service

"Pathetic drivers in Uber. Once the cab is booked, they come to the pickup point and cancel the ride saying we don't go to that location. Happens every time. Better switch to some other app."
Good and less price trip are available
The rates are okk.But sometimes it shows a rate before riding and it becomes higher after riding so it's not fair. The drivers charge extra payment always
"Very disapponited , very poor service. Takes 8-10 min to book ride and after confirmation it takes atleast 15-20 plus min ride to come so ultimately costing your half n hour. No sense to use such service"
The worst map and navigation system I have ever seen
Excellent app that is essential
Budget free rides

"I had no problem with this app until one of their drivers failed to complete payment. Even after payment of the said debt, the next driver did not complete payment, meaning I'd have to pay the same debt a third time to continue using their services. Reaching out to their customer service ,with evidence,has been of no help so far. Very disappointed."
Awesome 👍
Poor service. After trip confirmation auto driver ask for extra money through message.
Great service

"Hiked prices. Unreliable to get a cab back home after 4pm. when drivers take extra money, even after attaching the proofs, they reply about cancellation. offlate, highly unreliable and useless responses."
"It has happened to me twice, that driver didn't reach the pickup point enven 45 mins. Of agreed booking even confirmation on phone and I had to cancell my booking. The user instead of reprimanding the driver undesirably penalized me with Rs.21.This need be examined. We have other options also to travell with. Regards"
The app is convenient. Given 4 Star because In Mumbai while travelling to atal Setu drivers always insist to pay toll charges separately even though included in final bill. Please show final fare clearly indicating toll amount included in final bill to avoid duplication.

Such a nice and professional 👏 👌
"This is very bad,that few auto drivers charge more than the usual rate, initally the price was different and in the end of the ride(even though the driver had ended the ride prior to 100-200m from the destination),the price is showing else, how this is possible when the destination has also not reached and charge got increased?The auto driver's number plate was different and ride was going into his account.Very rude behavior of driver and abusive nature as well! Uber you need to work on it."

"Not updating, tried several times."
"Every time I use this app I pretty much feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I don't understand why the prices can change from $22 to $38 to go to the exact same place? Just because it's not 2: 00pm anymore it's 5:00pm. This app is pretty much a total scam, I try to avoid using whenever possible."
Always best 💯
Nice service
Great communication.
Your criminals in my perspective. I've worked with customer service and they proved inept. I have been getting charged for premium when I've deleted all payment methods and haven't used the service in over a year. F#@k anyone who makes decisions at Uber. You're theives and I'm looking into what repercussions I can inflict.
Great service!
Good service and helpful
It was a very enjoyable journey.
Biggest issue is drivers canceling at last miNutella- esp with reservations
Some of drivers show up but most of your drivers in Summit county Ohio are picky and will cancel a ride right after they find out where they are going and when they do it then charges $30 and $40.
It good
Peaceful trip
Very safe ride
Thank u!
"Works sometimes but hard to depend on. Further, I just took a ride which was supposed to be $50 and was charged $70 because the driver claimed I requested an additional stop which I did not. Uber customer support didn't even address the issue, they just said they couldn't refund me the difference. Instead they automatically added a tip for the driver. I recommend Lyft. This stuff doesn't happen there."
Very Nice Driver & very Very Nice Uber Thank you Both Are

Uber is good for me cheaper and good
"Ele é um app bom para viagens, portanto que não precise do suporte deles. Eles demoram para responder, em sua maioria as mensagens são automáticas que não responde as suas perguntas. Eles não respondem no Reclame Aqui também, o que já diz muito sobre a empresa né."
"I really don't like how, when my driver picks up my order, they suddenly have another stop to make before bringing my order to me."
Nice quiet & respectful 😊
"app cancels ride insistently as if it's expecting a dozen drivers in a dense city, ANNOYING FOR SMALLER CITY USE"

"Pathetic app.. charge higher thah other apps, takes longer time to pick up rides and have no safety guidande. The drivers can leave you in the middle of the road on main highway for no reason and there will be no customer support to help you except chat bott. Useless"
waiting time is too much
Refund services of other applications are very fast so why not the Uber.
Great ride
"I ordered, the order arrived missing half of what I ordered, the restaurant called and told uber they messed up and uber is still not giving me the refund and when calling customer service, the lady told me she couldn't dip anything but tell me to wait on a email. Completely useless customer service"
Very nice driver
easy to book with good rated and mannered driver.
"Sou usuária da uber desde 2016, quando lançou na minha cidade, sendo usuária VIP, com 4,94 estrelas. Mas nos últimos meses está horrível de usar. Escassez de motoristas, e vezes com o valor um absurdo. Mesmo pagando o dobro do valor tradicional, os motoristas recusam direto as corridas. Preciso mandar mensagem pra eles, quase que implorando para não cancelar, pq enquanto pago 40 reais na corrida, o motorista recebeu 23 reais (um exemplo recente), sem contar que muitos motoristas são grosseiros."

"I will update my review if my issue is resolved in an acceptable manner. I have used Uber for many years and for the most part have had a decent experience. I recently had an experience that I believe qualifies as a ""bait and switch"" scam and I attempted to resolve the issue through their customer service and received the same unsatisfactory response multiple times. I reserved and was charged for a premium vehicle but the driver showed up in a different, non premium vehicle."

"Full cheaters. No support from support team . Third class services. License of this company should be cancelled as torturing customers without any use. When drivers are not providing service why are they not taking it seriously. Secondly, never ever opt for their shuttle services as this is not a reliable service drivers will start your rides and will make you wait on the road for a long. Avoid using uber services it's of no use. Asking for grievance details but getting no reply."

"Have no problems with all of my rides, drivers are great. I have a big problem with uber canceling a pre scheduled ride on short notice claiming they can't verify payment, even though they have already blocked out ride amounts from my debit card, and allowing me to schedule a ride. If you don't have a card on file the application won't let you schedule a future ride. This is beyond stupid and it's gotta stop."

It's best but take time to come
"Worst app, no proper customer support for immediate assistance. The driver said his mobile got switched off at the end of the ride. He took money and went away. In this app we don't have option to end the trip from customer side and the trip was over at 8:35 P.M and still running it's 9:16 P.M now. Trying to reach driver, he is not picking call. This app doesn't even have customer support number, if called, it will tell to use help option in app. but there's nothing to raise any concern."
The driver's are available easily on all options of booking ride . It is better than their oppents. Excellent service in my city .
"Firstly, please do not cut me off as I am typing. Customer service is terrible. Uber has enough money after all of these years to provide top tier, real customer service agents, not simply ai! Secondly, the prices going from affordable to outrageous after you click on the originally shown price is crazy! It will say $9/$10 when go to book the ride, once the app says ""Finding your Ride"" it then says $15/$18/$20! How is that fair? I have screenshots and moving forward, I will be screen recording."

"Es una verga, una vez q buscas un destino no podés salir de la aplicación porque te aumentan cada vez más el precio a medida q buscas el mismo destino con segundos de diferencia. El mapa q dice q tan cerca está el auto es falso. Pedí un auto, decía q estaba doblando la esquina y llegando y no estaba y después de un rato q decía q estaba enfrente mio dice q el conductor CANCELO EL VIAJE."

"I have only one complain pll expedite the cancel issues. Maxm biker nowadays either demanding extra cash or cancelling our trip, which delaying a lot our schedules. Except this issues I hv no complain with uber."
"Unnecessary cancellation charges are demanded from customer, even if the driver cancelled the ride"
Great device and on time
The prices show on this app and the drivers are both different. When the destination has arrived I am unable to view the proper price and the auto driver has an increase amount from the initial amount shown in the app. Kindly rectify this issue.
Good behavior 👏 and very good drawing

I like Uber for convenience but I'm so tired of after every ride they go and charge you more then what you accepted to pay for the ride I honestly think it's against the law
Uber shuttle failed to pick me up inspite of me being at the exact location and after that the booking got canceled on itself .Also didn't get the refund of ₹1 which they promised they will be paying to me after the upi account verification .
Good driver.
Could be better.
"Lovely friendly driver, would highly recommend"
"It works so well, driver's get me from point A to point B. I love this app."

Sometime when driver is not satisfied with uber app price they cancel ride after reach to pickup point and when ride get cancel without customer fault uber charge a channelling to customers which is not good at all uber should take any any against it 😠

"These people are basically thieves in daylight. They added the disfunctional Uber eats in to the Uber app. They don't have delivery drivers from the restaurants which they publish and eventually cancel the order without a refund. They give a lame excuse that the restaurant has already prepared the order, So cannot give a refund. This is a robbery app. Stay away from it guys."
fast and affordable bike taxi
Promo given doesn't work
Absolutely amazing
Quick and convenient ride! I booked a cab with Uber and was impressed with how quickly it arrived. It didn't even take a minute to reach me
Good but somethings it sucks
Very bad Very high charge Just 1.3 km they charging 88 to 90 rs So i stopped taking uber
It's not good when driver cancel the ride and you have to pay for it☹️😔

They charge unnecessary cancellation fees for their fault and delays
"Twice in succession I have waiting far too long for a Driver to confirm, only for Uber to offer a quicker one at an increased price. Not good enough when you have been offered one fare and confirmed that you're accepting it."

I have been having the worst time with Uber customer support!! It's been 3 weeks now and they still haven't been able to resolve an issue I'm having trying to verify my identity. They haven't even tried to contact me to fix the problem. I have $$$ in my Uber cash wallet that I can't use or even order food with it. Needless to say I'm PISSED!!!!
Uber is the best. But it's scar's where I stay.
Worst app on this planet.They love to loot their customers so please don't install it sucks..
"No longer reliable like it used to be. The rides take longer than the bus trip, it's too expensive and the drivers complain of poverty which means the company got greedy"

Uber shuttle Driver did not stop at the location and despite calling him there was no response. Firstly the bus was late and then he drives past without stopping or even picking the call. Understand that you are offering a promotional free ride but doesn't count if the service is not serving the purpose. I wasted 30 min and had to make expensive travel arrangement to reach on time for another meeting. Poor service from Uber. Will not recommend Uber shuttle service.

"Been Multiple times, I use this app. I would give it a 1* for the B.S I put up with this app. Over half of my rides I have to walk away from the pickup zone. Had a Driver argue with me saying I need to ping it. I ping it for the next driver same B.S having to walk away from the pick up zone. Then I try Uber Eats. Having to walk, I show the driver my Pin. Then not even a min later. Driver calls me to verify my pin. When I live in apartments. Wants Verbal. Fix Your Navigation. Fix your Drivers."

"Dear team,  Yesterday evening faced terrible experience with Uber Shuttle at Salt Lake Kolkata. Shuttle no.WB19K 2516, Driver name Mr. Krishna Karmakar not stopped in specified stoppage, I was running & caught the shuttle bus, But driver misbehaving with me & stopped for boarding.  I am regular customer of uber, this type of behaviour not acceptable.  Please look into this matter & take strong action aginst the driver as a preventive action."
I had a delightful experience with the Uber app and I would definitely recommend it to kthers
Worst uber There show price after tht prices high... please Don't use When I try to call them There no response. Wost uber
"Absolutely trash experience Let me clear up the scenario for you, I had a single uber account, which I have been using for many years, I also have taken a lot of shuttle rides from that account, now Uber is refusing to provide me passes for shuttle in that account, god knows why, so I have created another account, where I have 5 free shuttle rides, now uber is not letting me add any UPI in that account, resulting in a failure of payments because they are not accepting cards as well."
"दुसरे शहर कि यात्रा में uber app से बुकिंग करवाने पर ड्राइवर लूटते हैं एसा अभी मेरे साथ हुआ! वृन्दावन से दिल्ली के बुकिंग में uber का भाड़ा के अलावा वो टोल टैक्स, हरियाणा दिल्ली स्टेट टैक्स चार्ज कर रहे थे। जब सब कि रशीद या प्रुफ मांगी तो कुछ बकझक के बाद थोड़ी हजामत कम हुई। मेरे पास इसके लिए पर्याप्त समय था अगर ये नही होति तो जो वो कहते वो देना पड़ता। मुझे लगता है इस तरह का अनुभव और यात्रियों को भी होती होगी! जो कि uber के साख पर पडता है इसीलिए लिपिबद्ध कर रहे हैं। इससे अच्छी व्यवस्था MMT की है"

"New dominant uber trend: You type the address (correcting the assumption/suggestion), the app ignores it and change it in a dark patternish way. Driver sent to the wrong location? Driver gave up, you are charged. Contest? Decipher the menu to earn ""Uber credits"" and achieve: your loss in real money, driver loss in everyway. Sad we have come to this as people :("
Easy to use

"I've been in one of the uber vehicles where it was no Neatness at all. When I asked the driver why is it so dirty, he said ""this is not our vehicles these are CNG Uber vehicles"" which cleans once in 30 days. But these vehicles operates 24 hours /day can't expect this especially from Uber"
Very comfortable reasonable price good
We arrived at SYD International Airport this afternoon. We unsure what to do but were given excellent assistance by a lovely young woman. The driver was efficient and got us to our destination.
"Service is not good as it's was at his initial time, drivers are very bad especially in Delhi, always I was payed more than the actual amount of the fare, drivers ask us to cancel the the ride and if we cancel it app charge us cancellation fees and if weren't drivers ask for extra money for the same journey... It was very embarrassing to facing such kind of problem with the reputative app like Uber.."
Sabse best service
Excellent driver and clean car Very help helpful

"If you have your card details saved they charge for rides and rectify the following day, but not the same amount withdraw."
Ok
"App says a car is available in 3 min then asks for another$10 to find the car faster, then takes 13 min to find the car when I refuse to pay extra. on top of that, you can't call the driver when the ride is connected. I hope Uber goes bankrupt so a better company wins"
Something is wrong in the app Wrong pickup location is shown to the driver every time
I got to where I was going on time
My driver was fantastic! Super polite I felt completely safe! And he was very good and professional when it came to his job!
Good service at night also
Most awfully experience using Uber Shuttle. They have created a monopoly and are now looting customers. Suddenly they have removed the Shuttle packages option for me whereas it is available for other riders. Why is it so? I cannot comprehend the reason. Fraud organization! Please dissolve Shuttle operations in Kolkata so that we can go back to leading peaceful lives.

"Great app to book Auto, cab and shuttles with very affordable prices compared to OLA and Rapido."
This damn company stole $10 31 from Uber cash. Maybe someone can help me because I spent most of my time trying to get my money back into Uber cash. My balance in Uber cash was $5.24. I bought an Uber gift card and loaded it with $15 for a total of $20.24. I booked a ride from 9700 Starbucks to Shell Providence Road Matthews for $9.93 that should have left a balance in Uber cash of $10.31. Uber took the $10.31 for no reason. I had to buy another Uber gift card and loaded it with $15.00.

App works slow and sends drivers to wrong address. When I tried to get a refund I was told that they had to get back to me.
It's so difficult to find how to add a tip. I've been tapping in circles for minutes now trying to tip my delivery driver. Still haven't found it

"Updated November review: I cannot buy train tickets on the app, it goes to the payment approval page, I accept payment on bank and then it refreshes back to the approval. The app lies about waiting times. I booked a ride expecting it to be a 1 minute wait as stated on the booking area, it turned out to be 15 minutes wait when a driver was found. There is no where to raise this issue on the app as this is not the fault of the Uber driver but the app providing false waiting times."
Excellent service driver arrived on time a very pleasant driver
"Uber doesn't let me log into my account, card It expired."
"Love love my driver. He was kind, polite and went above and beyond for me!!"
I love it
Fab !!!!
Always good!
Was over 30 minutes late twice due to drivers accepting the ride then sitting at the end of the street refusing to come down and giving me no cancel option until they finally declined it.
Support is awful. Scams you with the up to 20 percent off with shared rides. In reality it'll take 15 minutes out your day to knock a single dollar off the charge. When your spending 30 bucks that's embarrassing. Uber is such a scam. To update Uber sucks even worse. They now got the ride share giving wildly inaccurate time-frames and you always end up spending 15 to 20 minutes extra in a ride when they NEVER knock the dollar off even anymore. Disgusting and trash service. Wish there was better.
"I struggled to find my cab, and I got charged nearly an extra £10. Joke of a company. Wont be using again."
Too greedy!

Great app listens to there customer go above and beyond

"Extremely helpful, very polite and I hope to have him collect me again. Great driver."
"I have had a terrible experience today. A driver started the journey and never got to the doorstep, and I kept trying to text him, and he kept saying he was coming. Reported on the app, and they told me the 15 dollars deducted from me is the correct amount. I literally had to call Lift instead. I have had a driver accidententally start a journey twice before, but good thing the two of them communicated. Done with Uber!!!!!"
Reliable hard-working driver
Drivers ka dhyan rakha karo jara
I am new in this app
Discounts don't work because drivers rejecting them. They ask you the price it is displaying on your side then if they realize it's low they cancel
Nice Work for ride
Very nice and useful.
Got charged extra because the Uber map has wrong addresses and sends drivers on incorrect routes. There is NO ONE to talk to. Support is a bot with options and a FAQ.
Nice trip exactly driver
Even with all Spam settings turn off the Uber app continues to force spam advertising notifications. App can be clunky and hard to use at times.
"They always want to verify my identity when i ask a car in the early morning, so annoying since it's when i needed most"
Easy to use and love the tracking feature
Good cab service

"Today, I was waiting for the car . The car arrived at the wrong place. I phoned the driver,but there was no answer. I shared my live location to come and pick me up. He didn't turn up. In the end, I was charged by uber with out riding. It's a worse experience"
Good service
"Ride Service is good, but when things go wrong, customer service is terrible. One driver was very aggressive and demanded more money, and didn't complete the trip, leaving it running. And Uber refuses to let us review or give refund."

"Its a good app dont get me wrong but god damn those authorization holds can really mess you up. Taking money from your account like 2 or 3 months after a ride because it didnt come out of your account the first time , you know as a uni kid taking whatever little out of your account isnt a great experience."
Very good tour driver behaviour excellent and guide proper
Good app
no recomendable aveces cancelan el servio y también la mayoría de los conductores son deshonestos se quedan con cosas q no son suyas
Uber always makes our days easier. Very grateful
"The app is great. I just think that on uber eats, people should be allowed to rate the restaurant after a few hrs or day from delivery, cause rating the restaurant right after delivery is not logical since I can't rate food I haven't eaten. Also just like clothing shops I think we should be able view ratings of food and drivers. It'll improve the service and I don't get the point of reviewing if customers can't use it for their benefit. Also tipping before a service don't make sense."
Good
Excellent
Many times mor fair
"recently, secured a ride at ₹475 and was alloted a driver too. driver sent a message ""call me"" 10 minutes after booking and when I did he asked me to cancel and book again. he hadn't moved from his spot. when I asked why since I already have this one, he cut the call. i had no option but to cancel and try again, when i tried the price was suddenly ₹1018, more than double of the initial amount. wasted around 45 minutes and still got no cab. I usually have minimal problems with uber."
Your navigation system is soo bad that after Booking my cab I always suggest driver from the location
Good
Great ride! Rogelio did a fine job!
DONT ASK FOR A TIP IF IM PAYING OVER $6 TO HAVE THE FOOD I PAYED EXTRA FOR TO BE DELIVERED!!!chat is buggy doesnt show when they reply over half the time took 3hrs to switch between app and site back to app for a message to actually connect. Their eats is a joke seriosuly dont waste your time after you wait half an hr to connect they are to retarded to not connect to someone out of range .charge extra on each item on-top delivery fee on-top tax's and another delivery fee
"The company has become robotic, expensive, uncaring."
"Today, I had the worst experience with this cab company. I booked a bike cab from my office to home, & the bike details provided were for a TVS Raider with the number 8276. However, the driver arrived on an old Splendor with the same number plate. How is this even possible? To make things worse, the driver was in such a hurry that he completely ignored traffic rules. This recklessness led to a crash with another bike, resulting in an injury to my knee & damage to my clothes. is this acceptable??"
"Booking is hassle-free, drivers are awesome"
"The app is overall good but the customer service when you have problem with the driver is hopeless. So I had problem with the driver twice, he didn't stop the ride. Then I had to stop it myself. Then I tried to give review to the driver for his bad behavior and I couldn't because I canceled the ride. I still paid him full money and more though... so I told the service about it and thet didn't refund me or allowed me to review the driver. So customer support does nothing :)"
Good app
Very good driver. Courteous and kind
You're giving us mini heart attacks by taking our money before the ride. That was rude!
Price increase after completing ride
Nice
Over charged for the same ride i take everyday then they tell you its because the demand for rides is higher but i see cars available and in the same spot on uber map not to mention the extra money taken for the same ride doesn't go to the driver its a scam if you ask me
2 Drivers canceled my ride because they can't find my location and got a charged with cancelation fees 2 times
"As a service, Uber consistently fails to meet expectations. The core purpose of the platform is to deliver reliable and convenient transportation, yet it often falls short. Whether it's delayed rides, cancellations, or poor customer support, there seems to be a lack of accountability for these recurring issues. If the service can't deliver on its primary promise, what's the point of using it?"
Good and lowest cost
Good advice
"Jab bhi uber se booking kia ,har bar 200-250 rupya extra hi dena para...gatiya cab booking app...isse badhiya to ola hai...jitna me ola cab book karte hai..utna hi dena padta hai..."
Anyone who has a 3 star or above does not regularly use Uber. They intentionally increase prices for individual customers if they think you will keep going to the same location. They charge you more and rip off the drivers. Their fees are ridiculous and only seem reasonable if you use them to get to very different locations and use the app very rarely. It's a stupid business decision and very exploitative. Imagine having a restaurant and charging your most frequent customers more. 0 stars
Nice
We used the Uber app while on holiday in the UK. We had an excellent experience with the app. It was easy to use and entering the data was quick. We even added a tip via the app. We'll use this service again while traveling through Europe.
"It won't open uninstalled, reinstalled won't open"

I am from Hyderabad this app don't show straight road to pick us. it make a 1 or 2 kilometres long to pick us and ride driver too cancel the ride is they think wayis too long .... So this app make for waste our time 😔
Es horrible cuando la aplicación se equivoca o el repartidor dice que no le pagaron o no entrego el pedido. La app te cobra y no hay manera de que te lo descuenten.
Nowadays uber drivers are asking cash for digital payments selected before ride started. If we pay cash to the digital payment then as per uber policy it shows as pending and you need to pay again to uber.So be careful before using uber ride.
Good
Nice ride 😃
Better than taxis
Always perfect timing. Very fast efficient. I never had any bad drivers so far. My experience for the last 6 years. It's perfect. That's all how I can describe it.

"Used to be great in sheffield, now just leaves you waiting 20 mins plus, then tries to stop you cancelling the search when youre stuck walking miles in the dark instead. had some shady drivers try to scam and support refused to help. I recommend any of the alternatives which are far more consistent"
I've had Uber overcharge me
"Brilliant taxi service, recommend to everyone."
Excellent first experience. On time pick up and driver was very nice
always reliable and safe...
"Works ok when I can get a driver. Tells you it's gathering drivers details when it doesn't have one yet then just says can't find a driver and kicks you out so if there's acue you get sent to the back. Took one to Walmart the other day, all was fine until I tried to get one home and ended up stranded there. They were closed by this point too so I was stuck standing outside in the cold until I finally got a hold of a friend to come get me. Phone was almost dead. Few more mins cold walk home"
Smooth

Rider is very good 👍👍👍👍
The sharing of location with the driver helped immensely in a remote area like Yate.

Most awful horrible company you can't get a hold of customer support I don't think they have customer support to be honest and what I just had to deal with literally made me cry I don't understand how they charge you for a ride if they don't have a ride to provide you with to begin with like how about you make sure you have someone before taking there money cause now my poor husband is still stranded on I-75 and since you weren't able to get a driver to pick him up an I need that money to gethim

Customer service is horrible I lost an item in the vehicle and i try to call the driver but the application claims that i am calling from a different number from what is registered in my account WHICH IS COMPLETELY WRONG and i cant neither call the driver nor call an uber customer service to report the problem!!!!! Horrible horrible service I wont use this stupid application again!
Please add all key icons on the map while trip is active love the new features
Kept me waiting for 45 minutes only to tell me that no driver is available.
Good app

I'm new to Uber and have trouble using my phone - my computer was fine.
"Took money out the wrong bank account😑, refund my money..."
I got charged a trip I didn't take because the driver started the ride and finished it in 3 minutes I had to pay the amount in thw next trip I took
Great 👍
"The driver knows his job too well We travelled comfortably, we requested a stop at a drug store he agreed without complaining. Anyway today i enjoyed the ride"

"Every time they charge me, they always cancel the ride, and then they charge me more money after they cancel the ride. Oh yea when i try to talk to the bot about how they are canceling the ride after it, it doesn't help you get your money back when they charge you more."
Constantly taking money out for trips I haven't done
Good Ride
very good but expensiv
"Thank you for providing & helping public uber counter in Air port places. Thanks to Uber counter staff for helping in booking & arrangements of Uber vehicle to reach in our destination point. I hope public uber counter facilities will be increase in important public places for public benefit. But,There is somedraw back , sometimes after booking confirmation by uber vehicle , they reject (cancel) booking, due to this rider(customer) often face Harass. I hope this problem will be solve in future."
Good experience so far 😁
Great service great staff x
Good service
Nice driving
Uber car Pilot person Behavior is good & Softly talking about our journey.
good for low cost of booking
Frequent cancellations ....somedays 2 or 3 times in same trip..even at normal working hours...users penalized for any cancellation while drivers can do it after making you wait for 5 minutes.
Amazing

Worst App. Every Time its take too much time for booking. Drivers pehle kehte hai kaam nahi hai lekin jab booking Karo toh nakhre itne ki location hi nahi aayenge
Good service
Nice app
Complete trash. Always false timings
Worst customer service and time to time not pickup the customer and long route auto driver cancel the pickup 🤬🤬🤬
Drivers are demanding double the price. Worst experience
"Most Uber drivers drive extremely slow, even when there isn't traffic, and I end up paying way more than the requested amount."
Excellent
"it has gone bad, i paid directly to the driver on phonepe as driver asked me to, and now the same charge is showing me on the uber app,"
Very affordable
Long waiting.. worst
Way better then the taxis
Excellent work

The price they show you before requesting the trip is not the price you pay
First time. Fast and simple
Fabulous 😍
Nice aap
Brilliant no fuss service
Bring good packages for Uber Shuttle.
Super
The worst app ever too late to pick up and the location is not precise worst been late so many times because of this app
"The app won't accept credit or debit cards as methods of payments. I use the account with a family member, the only available payment option is card for family accounts. Their support service was not helpful at all."
Even single star is waste... Driver will not lift the call and they won't reply and for cancelation again they will charge on us.... I wait upto 10min and called driver and I cancelled and I got cancelation fee.. This is second time and I'm not going to use it at all
I'm using Uber to work every morning but mostly i have to wait for 45minutes to get a ride then end up arriving late at work
"Most drivers are very experienced and use Google Maps, but sometimes there are drivers who watch films ."
Waste app full laging in 8gb gram
Better service and good drivers also clean cars
I was charged $34.22 in addition to the $46.74 I agreed upon for 1 ride. The artificial intelligence gives you no option to dispute the other charge. I'll call a taxi next time and save myself the headache and phone storage.
Nice

"I rode in my first electric vehicle and the guy explained how they work in a way that anybody can understand. I've never had a bad experience in an Uber and tonight was no exception, it was quite the opposite actually. I learned so much about cars. It was just awesome. Cool driver, super fun ride"

Worst service don't want to promote any more it's taking more 1 hour to book a if it is book it get cancelled or waiting time 20 mins after 15 min driver called confirm location and cancelled the ride seriously worst service
It's save time
MONOPOLY SYSTEM
Good behaviour
Good
it's amazing ride
"It charges you for the trip. Then, if you leave a tip it charges you again for the trip plus tip. Then, they let payment in pending for two weeks to get your first trip charge and the tip back. So you pay double and get the extra amount back after two weeks. The customer support lies about a cancellation fee. The cancelation fee is supposed to be charged before the trip, not after!"
Nice to use
Thank you and good service
Day by day uber giving worst service unable to book ride it is taking more than 20-30 mins to allot a driver and driver also doing fraud asking more money also taking wrong way no one is taking action against them

"Great app we all are using it quite some time as it is a very fast & quick travelling service to our regular & fat off places, I am happy with their prompt service as budget is also concerned, Thanks Uber."
Generally good app and Iv had no negative experiences
"Using Uber a few years already from time to time. Nice UI and easy to use. Payment with PayPal is a great thing as well, although I noticed that lately I pay more. Although when booking the price said was: €11-15, in the end I paid €19,20, which is a quite big difference. I would have preferred to know the higher price rather than having this unexpected surprise."
Good
Dismissive Customer care and they take your money! Avoid paying with your card cause you will be charged even if the driver cancels the ride.The customer care is also really dismissive and doesn't offer a solution of what can be done incase the issue occurs again. If I could attach proof of conversation I would

Worst experience ever I booked my ride I am waiting for it app for showing that driver will come in 1 minute and I am waiting for 25 minutes I am deleting this app I will never book any Uber cab about taxi ride
Pathetic experience . I don't use uber . My account has an unrecognised charge with no date . Customer support is unreachable . They don't want to solve the issue . They just want to make money .
Very good sarvice
Very useful for travellers
As good as ever!
Good App
"This happened to me 2 times. For the first time when it happened, i didn't pay much attention to it. But for the second time, i couldn't ignore it. Uber is charging me extra money. I booked a ride which showed 110rs. But when i reached my destination, the driver told me it's 125 rs. He told me to check my Uber app to clarify, and to my surprise, he was right. Uber charged me extra money after confirming the ride and couldn't give a reason for it. I request you to fix this issue asap."
Horrible... you coming to get me or not.... Hate Liberals that can't answer easy questions..... Redicilous!
Ok it's nice

"It's very driver centric. A driver can leave you on the street, not show up,pass right in front of you and not pick you up, not pick up his phone. And you will be charged with a 10 qar fee. Sorry Uber some other legal local applications are performing much better."
Excellent! It even recognizes when it's traveling someone else when you choose another pick-up point than your actual address and it opens your Agenda to help you rapidly choose a contact.

Uber R&D is unique and it is everytime helpful to the public like Uber eats because on that time we eat like 25 rupees biryani and now I am going to college on the zero rupee and they are giving fine service during R&D and normally paid service too... Hatsoff to the brillant minds of uber.
Great experience
"As a frequent uber rider, I believe there should be more discounts or incentives for frequent rides"
"Gets me around, hassle free. Most drivers are very professional and courteous. I recommend."
Saving my life since forever lol
Pathetic service uber. I tried to add my card in the account. But my 2 rs were deducted 5times but the card was not added. There is no proper number to give a call. I will escalate this to social media as well and I need my money back
Good app Resonable prices
I am so tired of Uber. Auto driver cancel after reaching on destination. They dont even inform. They take different routes and then when we guide them over call they cancel the rides. Even 4-5 rides gets canceled without any valid reason. On top of it uber prices are hiked by 10x these days for unnecessary reasons.
Super raider best regards
Good on time service and affordable price...
So easy and cheap.
Very bad experience
Commission is fare
"Trying for 20 mins, knowing that it's cheaper in the mornings, only for no driver to accept, and then the prices to increase to 3 times the amount due to ""peak usage"".. I had Uber One, was considering getting it again, not anymore. Try and keep your prices consistent.. this is why you losing business and trust"
Most of the time reliable and affordable
No issue..
"I always book my ride by using this app since last 10 years, but unfortunately due to some booking problem I have deleated the app and downloaded once again today ....!"
"Capitalising at its peak.Offering normal fare to the riders far away and make us wait for long.And if we cancel it, then give us nearby drivers for 1.5 times more prices.I would suggest to install other platforms too so that you can decide at that time."
I think that if there is something less than 1 star it would be my rating I can imagine that my driver is standing somewhere in the universe and then he tells me that he arrived then I tell him to come cuz I'm late he tells me he arrived and finally when I cancel him to get another car Uber demands me to pay extra 20 QAR fix ur drivers please
Amazing
Very convenient
Service is so bad 👎
Very bad very very bad
The hurrier you in the more late this app makes you.

Just had yet another outstanding experience with my driver Paul who was kind enough to wait for me at the auto parts store even though I had not requested a stop when I booked the ride. He just provided top notch service all the way around not to mention that Paul was Uber-professional! Big thanks to Paul for giving me a reminder why I've loved this app since they opened and been a loyal customer ever since.
Love it
Nice
Super 💯
Excellent behaviour and service
Very good 👍👍
"Very disappointed in Uber. I use them twice a day, 5 days a week to get to work and back home. I live 3 minutes from my work and for the past year the rates have been $5 or $6. All of a sudden they charge an average of 10 to 20$. And I've never missed a tip to the drivers. I'm stuck because I need the ride but I can't afford it anymore. When your prices go back down you'll get the 5 star rating I gave at the start"
Fair is completely overpriced and drivers are underpaid. I'd rather walk
good service very nice
Very easy to use. Mohammed was great.
"Arbitrary and unexpected pricing, drivers can be confused or rude, longer than expected waits for pick up, frequent unreliable service."

Too much time taken for confirming the ride. Disappointed overall.

Reported this many years ago but why do you require 3 STEPS to CANCEL A TRIP REQUEST (not even a confirmed trip)? This is just ridiculous that it isn't fixed yet.
👍🏻
Multiple times when my order is canceled. The only reply is that we are working on these situations. App is slowly getting worse and the customer just has yo feal with it although uber applies high charges for their service. Terrible.

Uber I am officially deleting you!!! I will rather struggle with Bolt then one more bloody day light robbery from you. I have had countless upcharges. This is the last straw. I cannot pay R50 and then later I am charged R75 rand . You cannot do that!. I accepted the ride at R50!!! IF YOU USE THIS LYING CHEATING APP!! ONLY USE CASH. CHEATING SCUM!!!
"Best way to go, when you're out having fun and DRINKING. ESPECIALLY with the Holidays Parties 🙏🏾"

A great way to get around when you don't want to use your own car
Driver was very friendly
GREAT GROUP OF DRIVERS! CLEAN! TRUSTWORTHY IN MY OPINION!
Good service
"I won't use your app anymore. After your drivers cancelled my request which they initially accepted, you still went ahead and asked me to pay. They cancelled my order without picking me up and you asked me to pay. You expect me to pay for your inconsistency. You or them are supposed to pay me for wasting my bloody time. I almost missed going to see my sick grandfather that night. I wish i could make everyone to stop using your app because you have no idea how much stress you put me through"
"Constantly spams you with ad notifications, but if you take notifications off you miss ride information."
Quick and not expensive cars taxis
Great
Good experience and reliable too
My experience today is terrible. I had a ride scheduled and the driver cancelled. This was over a half hour ago. Still trying to schedule a ride with no luck. I really need this ride and it's getting late. Please help!
Buena herramienta
$10 to get mcdonalds 5 min down the road delivered you guys are trippin
V Košiciach zatiaľ slabé pokrytie. Niekedy čakám 20 minút.
Good idea but unreliable. Drivers keep on cancelling after waiting a long time. I won't use uber anymore for important drives.
"Dunno if it's supposed to be a new feature or if it's a bug, but instead of going by my current location as it usually does today 11/25 it said that I was down the street at the coffee shop instead of at home wasting both my and the drivers time and the address wasn't editable because it was 'out of range' despite only being a mile down. Definitely didn't do this before, and it even showed me the correct pin when I booked it, which is further confusing to me."
Great alternative to airport parking!

Looks good till you use it
From One side 1130 Same return trip 531 This is wrong... Uber fraud to us...
"I booked an UberX cab earlier and it said the journey cost was £15.85 when it was booked, then the amount in the end subtotaled £16.39, £0.99p was added as a waiting time so it should have been £16.84 but I was charged £17.38 which I do not understand and the help options offer no solution, I read everything and do not see why the fare price changed. Also when first using the app I had to take a relative to hospital using a family account for payment, and they blocked my Uber account."
Lovely friendly driver. Very comfortable ride. Totally enjoyed the ride
"Uber is good sarvice, very fast, give a car, i am Living in Qatar, thanks tha uber company"

"5 Sterre vir Kagiso Alfred! Kagiso is beslis een van die beste Uber-bestuurders wat ek tot nou toe gehad het. Sy motor is mooi skoon en het 'n lekker geur, wat die rit baie aangenaam maak. Hy speel ook die beste 90's en 80's musiek van my kinderdae! Dit is duidelik dat hy uit sy pad gaan om seker te maak dat sy kliënte tevrede en gelukkig is. Ek beveel hom beslis aan!"
"Total scam. Was given a discount code but it wouldn't work. Not sure about business model here, but try to avoid as service/delivery fee quickly add up and promo codes never work - it only becomes obvious when at the final order stage."
"Worst aap to choose your destination, their divers don't follow instructions and the location"

"Driver made it up the mountain with 2"" of fresh snow right on schedule. He was pleasant and didn't talk my ear off. He played some very nice ambient music which was very soothing. Unlike many drivers, he wasn't afraid to drive as quickly as the conditions allowed. Previous drivers seemed afraid of the mountain roads and drove at glacial speeds. This gentleman drove very safely but also understood that people have things to do and the Uber ride is just a means to an end."

"The driver was very cool and car arrived b4 time, no time to waste."
"Difficult to change my home and work addresses. I would change them repeatedly, save the change if that was an option on the screen, then go to the previous screen again and find out that my home or work addresses had reverted to their previous settings. Tried multiple times, tried exiting and restarting the app, didn't seem to make any difference. Mildly annoying. Other settings such as checking my reserved ride were a little challenging to find, but that may change as I use the app more. 4"
El problema que tiene es que permite que los conductores cancelen hasta que terminan el viaje anterior.
Wow
"Drivers simply don't want to work. No one takes the ride and what was supposed to be a fast solution to public transportation is slowly becoming another problem. Also, changing the fare for a more expensive one in the middle of a search for ""faster pickups"" is pure dishonesty. 2 stars for the good drivers that still want to work"

Uber doesn't have much option to contact the company. How much responsibility rests on the driver? If you have a trip to or from the airport, there will be luggage...."

The safety measures are good. The share options of your trip to other person and the live update all good for safety but I am very disappointed for a trip I was charged twice for one trip and more extra fee if $3 for no reason. Their live chats never available. No success to get customer support. considering not to use Uber anymore.

"Greed taken to the extreme. 0 stars. One 20-minute ride costs as much as a train ticket, to there and back, to the mountains or the seaside. The price is exaggerated."
Becoming trash. App try to exploit profit from customer and drivers more and more making drivers less inclined to drive and trips less pleasant.

"The estimate on time at this point is almost completely inversed. Initially, if there is an estimated wait time of 5 minutes or less, I'll end up waiting for nearly half an hour, but if the estimate is 20 minutes or so, I'll only end up waiting 3-5 minutes. Not the end of the world, but it is extremely difficult to plan for when I need to be somewhere."
Very interesting man
Good experience

"Easy navigation, had no problems."
I have book my trip when i book its show less amount and after booking the rate got increesed and also i can't cancel the trip it didn't show the reason i want to tap and also show if i cancel the trip they will charge extra 60 rs on my next trip
It says there is an offer of 5% cash back for Amazon Prime members if paid through Amazon Pay Balance. But I have paid several times and not received cash back ever
"1 out of 3 drivers wait until they are near to ask, ""Where are you going?"" this way, if they don't want to take you, you have to cancel and pay for the cancelation fee since they are near already by."
Stephane is very friendly and respecful. This is my second time using Uber and happy. It is very convinient.
Thank you for all the rides.
"First driver never arrived, so the 5 minute arrival turned into 13 to 15 minute wait until the second driver arrived. The second driver was quite good. No complaints about him, just the fact that the first assigned driver never arrived. This is the second time this happened from the same location."

Great app !!
Impeccable experience 👌
"Best deal available for Customer, Some issue with Location... Other wise all Good"

"En México se presenta a qué choferes rateros te cobren extra ya que te bajas del auto, por qué solo aceptan pagos en efectivo, me pasó una vez en el DF, que me cobraron casetas extras, que ya se las había pagado al chófer y nuevamente en puebla, me cobraron un reembolso en efectivo que nunca ocurrió, desafortunadamente no pude hablar con una persona, todas mis quejas no pasaron del bot que usan, y no da una opción para choferes rateros"

"App is a trash when it comes to Turkiye. Drivers can charge you at the end, and you don't know the reason. They are also putting toll fees on you. The help button to reach out to the help centre of Uber is not working. It stopped showing the prices for Poland, however previously i could see"
Good riding 😊
On time every time
I lost my phone number. How am I supposed to update it to the new one if you ask me to input a code that you sent me to my old number?

I enjoy my experiences with Uber. The app is a little complicated. But I guess as I use it more often I think I can manage it. The fluctuating prices if the ride is annoying. The price should be more affordable and flexible especially if we have routine rides.
Good Driver. Right on time. 👍🏾
Wow Uber is now best known for scam also initially they charged 210 and after reaching destination it charged 280 !! It's not very much but it happens all the time
excellent service with excellent behaviour

Why there is no delete option included or not there if the trip is cancelled or not booked on the Uber application? Little more changes to be done in the UI of Uber application.
No es justo que los conductores cancelen todo el tiempo haciendonos llegar tarde y que encima tengamos que pagarle por sus vuajes cancelados.
excellent
Great 👍

Got a worst experience!!! I had to pay extra even though I didn't cancelled it and I was also charged with the cancellation fees I need that back !!!!
"Love this feature. Works great when you are in need of a scheduled trip, like going to the airport early in the morning."
Excellent....!!
Uber is overpriced and they will charge you based on how long the ride took (even if there's construction on the road)

Excellent service
This is most app
Perfectly
Always friendly drivers.
Auto not available most of time please look in this case
its not a safe app . you aleady took money twice from my bank account . without me taking a ride . second reason . alot of times i go out side and wait up to 15 minute for the rider to come . and its ok for you but if he waited less than 1 minute you take money from my account . why not the oppostie . why its okay for me to wait while holding a baby for up to 15 mnts and not okat for the rider to wait less than a minute . you have double standards .
"Sometimes when ordering a ride the questions the app asks in terms of destinations do not pin correctly. Otherwise, when set up correctly, the at works quite well."
Thanks for the immediate support I loves uber
"Used for Uber eats, didnt apply the prices advertised on a Sainsburys shop and nearly payed double for my order"

Best App in reasonable prices Thnkx to Uber
Some times drivers are canceling the bookings in selected cities unnecessarily making us to feel bad about this application company kindly go through it & make slight change in this application as in "ola app" google maps shows when we are traveling each & every road/cross/location but in your app only location & destination it shows that's it plz make this update thanking you !!!
Worst service i never seen 0/10
Good experience on the app
Very high fair price
He is goof
Terrible app for food. Had so many deliveries not turn up or arrive an hour after time.. Spend 100s a week getting taxis but can't refund 20 quid for a macdonalds that wasn't delivered. Disgusting way to treat loyal costumers
Best app
I don't use it
When you have some very urgent need then it is of no use and we do not take advance booking.
Great
I had to get a bigger vehicle because of my walker. When what I needed was a car with a proper trunk. I shouldn't have had to pay more. Then wasn't able to reach anyone to explain what the issue was. So instead of 11.89 I had to pay 19 and change. There is a fee for that. Was not happy.
too bad wrost

"I'm writing to report a concerning issue I've experienced with two recent Uber rides, including one today. Despite booking and paying for my rides through the app, the drivers demanded extra money. Today, I booked an Uber, and the driver called me to confirm the pickup. However, he also asked about the payment and, upon learning it wasn't what he expected, demanded extra money. When I refused, he refused to take me to my destination and asked me to cancel the ride."
Very affordable other then apps. Thankyou Uber. Highly recommend guys..go for uber rides.
"Nice app, economical rates"
king of last minute cancellations. Totally unreliable for any important events.
I am so happy 😊

"I was told I had a cancelation fee and had to pay for the driver's time and effort before requesting another trip, but the app doesn't stipulate the time and date of this infraction. How am I supposed to know if it's legitimate without that corresponding information? I never cancel trips or have people wait on me."

I don't need own car with Uber around.
The driver was friendly and he talked about his experience with rude and silly passengers.
"Man, this app is a mix of bad and good. For me"
Much better experience than Ola
Still frustrated that drivers are allowed to accept a ride and then reject it meaning you can wait longer and the price goes up
You are the best!

My driver was wonderful! He acomedated me. By taking a faster route so that I asked to please take since that I wouldn't get to my job late. 🙂 he was a total gentleman. Very polite. Thank you uber. 🙂

"Very helpful to new immigrants who don't have a means of transport. Very quick response and very well organised. safe drive, polite drivers, reliable..."
Shocking service. Waited inside the hospital at 3am after a family member had just passed away. Ride was accepted so I went out through the security doors to wait for the ride. Driver then cancelled the ride leaving me stuck outside in the rain with no taxi. If a driver accepts the ride they shouldn't be able to cancel it for another. Thank god there's still normal taxi companies to call and I was able to get home.

I have been a regular customer of uber from last 8 years and for the first time I am being unhappy with the services.Its been more than 30 mins and no driver have been assigned to me.Although it's a office time.and I am facing it since 1 week.Kindly check and resolve.
"Very professional, friendly and affordable. Of I wasnt a pensioner, I would have tipped much more."
Service of uber is very god in comparison to others.
Fair price having plesent ride..
Great app. Could be a little better communicating with the driver for pickup
Great to use in different countries especially to avoid handling cash. However the app regularly shows less than the actual fare by showing discounts that mysteriously disappear when I actually make the booking - and by the time you realise it's too late. This has happened to me several times now and really puts me off using the app as I can't rely on the quoted price being the price I will actually pay!!
Bad experience The rider are doing cancel my ride again and again its too much I never will chose this app for Book a ride they took only higher amount ride only I am goona install this app right now.
Good

Koi bhi driver bhai non cash trip soch samajh kar lagaye kyunki agar customer complete dalta hai ki driver ne mujhse cash liya to uber aapki Puri payment kat kar customer ko refund kar deti hai Uber ke pass aapki value zero hai isliye online payment soch samajh kar lagana

Drivers are very rude I booked the ride driver name govind was using another mobile bike cab app may be rapido was at another user pickup place I ask him he is not at pickup place he was very rude and say u can complaint about me and was not coming to pickup location it was complete harassment and got late at my office who is responsible for this I rate this to driver have rude and egoistic behaviour.

Robyn was the best pet Uber period.
Drivers shouldn't be able to cancel trips they've already accepted without a penalty.
"Doesn't work. No support. It used to work, and now it doesn't. Update, uninstall, reinstall, update payment method. Uber only communicates via message, and repeatedly ask for the same information already provided. I would have expected Uber to be able to afford to have support available to all."
Nice drive
Awesome
"Bad enough the drivers aren't vetted, but they also don't show up."
An excellent way to get home and do shopping but I have to have to worry about the taxi cab!!!
♥️
Worst application I've been waiting for the driver to pickup since 30mins and trying to book but whenever someone picks up they says we take night charges and on uber se don't take night pickup as they give us less amount Then why the hell you guys keep your application open at night when your driver's don't accepts the pickup and night idiots really disappointed and uninstall this app It's a suggestion not to download this application it will waste your time
Some time high prices
I've had it a few months and have used it quite often I have always had a nice driver who is responsible and kind and not got one thing to say wrong about it
Great comfortable fast and easy
My driver was AWESOME!!!
I Was More Than 35m In One Location

"Worst algorithm in some European cities. Why advertise a fare that no driver takes? At Geneva airport, I was waiting for a driver for an agreed fare of CHF 38. After 10 mins of waiting to match me with a driver, I get a request to accept the fare at CHF 98?? Are you mad?"
great trip.
Very good driver

"My driver was friendly, knowledgeable about the area, and was a good driver. I enjoyed my ride!"

Muy amable
"Useless, can't count how many times I've tried to use it and not have anyone commit to a pick up"
Sumon was kind and engaging when we asked about the area
Lately it is telling me the driver is on the way when I'm already in the car. And it does this multiple times per trip. Very annoying. And at first it was concerning too! I just updated it and it's still doing that.
I am not sure what has taken place the past months but I hope to see a class action lawsuit for the misleading times that come up for how far the driver is away. Not accurate and the you select what you are assuming is how ever far away the driver is and then you go to finding driver and infant there are no drivers that times distance away. This had been happening consistently for.the pat few months then it says will connect to a driver by another time after. What was 4 min was 25 to wait lie
Hi I have been trying to contact Uber help line but can't find it I was basically robbed by one of its drivers could someone please help me.

Uber specially gets cancelled by the drivers also they send messages or asks extra money also the location shared they ask the details or they keeps you waiting for hours so that they can get extra money very pathetic experience 😒 but some drivers are really good .
Prices are usually reasonable. Wait times are kinda long. Overall a good app.

Recently I took an Uber and I accepted one fee that I could afford just to find out later that they had over chargede by $7.50 and when trying to reach them to talk about it they insisted on saying that I had agreed to the fictious price when I know without a doubt that I had not agreed and they refused to reimburse the extra fees that they had added they are getting away with robbery !!!!!!
"Worst app I ever saw,i downloaded this app today for 1st time and I ordered a cab of 6 members. At first the driver didn't took call and later the cab was cancelled which was not done by me, the driver did it. Then I try to order a new cab But uber is asking me 80 rs becoz I wasted the time and energy of the cab driver 🤣. Really satisfied by the driver and app 🤣🤣. Highly recommended app."
Well driven
Works as described.
Great and safe trip..had chats with the driver .I enjoyed the ride . thank you
Useful in a pinch but I hate using it. I think they lie to their drivers about the percentage take. Also didn't know this but about 60% of all riders tip ZERO. Unions are needed bad to get some driver's rights in this bish if it's here to stay

"This company uses unethical methods of having you pay more than you think you are paying.
